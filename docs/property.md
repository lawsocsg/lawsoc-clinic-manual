Purchasing or Selling a House or Flat
-------------------------------------

### Things To Consider When Purchasing A House Or Flat

When purchasing a house (“House”) or a flat (“Flat”), you should
consider the following and address any problems that may arise:

1.  Title
2.  Single or joint ownership
3.  ‘Landed’ or ‘non-landed’ property
4.  Area of the property
5.  Financing of purchase of property
6.  Marital status

#### **1. Title**

You should consider the title to the House or Flat and seek advice from
your lawyer about it. Title is important because good title over your
property means no third party can make any better claim than what you
have.

**House – landed property**

The title to the House may be:

-   Freehold: Where ownership of the property technically lasts forever
    (Absolute title or an estate in perpetuity)
-   Leasehold: Usually a lease for 99 years or 999 years. Note that as
    the lease period may have commenced some time ago, meaning little
    lease period remains. You should seek advice prior buying such a
    property.

**Flat - HDBs, ECs, private condominiums**

The title to the Flat may be:

-   A common law lease (under the old conveyancing system) for 99 years
    or 999 years with no interest in the land or with a proportionate
    fractional share in the land subject to the lease.
-   A strata title where the proprietor will have a title to the flat
    with a proportionate share in the land (freehold or leasehold) on
    which the flats had been erected.

#### **2. Single or joint ownership**

Before deciding whether to buy a House or Flat, you should check if you
are buying it on your own or jointly with another/others. Buying the
House or Flat with another will affect things such as ownership of the
House / Flat and the financing for the purchase of it.

If you are buying the House or Flat jointly with another person, you
hold the property as (i) joint tenants, or (ii) tenants-in-common. The
difference affects who will inherit the House or Flat when one party
dies.

**Joint-tenancy**

**Equal interest regardless of contribution:** A joint-tenancy is a form
of ownership where all co-owners have an equal interest in a flat,
regardless of the individual owner’s contribution to buy the flat.

**Right of survivorship:** In a joint-tenancy, there is a right of
survivorship. This means if one joint tenant dies, his interest in the
flat *automatically* passes to the remaining co-owner(s). This is
regardless of whether the deceased joint tenant has left behind a
Will.[^1] The right of survivorship will override any terms in the will.

**Example:** Mr. X, his wife and their son own a HDB flat as joint
tenants. Mr. X dies. The flat automatically passes to Mrs. X and their
son, who will have to continue to service the monthly loan instalment
unless the outstanding loan is paid up by the mortgage insurance arising
from Mr. X’s death.

**Advantages:** A joint tenancy has certain advantages as a means of
owning land. For example, for probate purposes, no further vesting of
title in the other co-owner is required. For sale or mortgage purposes,
only one title needs to be investigated. For succession purposes, it is
unnecessary for one co-owner to make any testamentary gift of his or her
share to the other.[^2]

**Tenancy-in-common**

A tenancy-in-common is a form of ownership where each co-owner holds a
separate and definite share in a flat.[^3] Unless stated otherwise, they
are presumed to own an equal share in the property. However, all the
co-owners are entitled to live in the whole flat regardless of their
share in the property.

**No right of survivorship:** There is no right of survivorship in
tenancy-in-common. The deceased’s interest in the flat does not pass on
automatically to the remaining co-owner(s). When a tenant-in-common
dies, his interest in the flat will be distributed according to his
Will. If he does not have a will, it will be distributed by law
according to the provisions of the Intestate Succession Act.[^4]

A joint-tenant can sever the joint tenancy by an instrument of
declaration (usually a deed and form approved by the Registrar), and
serving it personally or by registered post to the other joint tenants.
The fees chargeable include stamp duty, conveyancing fees, etc. The
actual amount varies from case to case depending on the values of shares
transferred and the flat type etc. The declarant will hold the
respective estates and interests in the land as tenant-in-common with
the remaining joint-tenants, and the Registrar of Titles will equally
apportion the shares in the registered land between the declarant and
the remaining joint-tenants. If a joint-owner cannot be located, a
presumption of death certificate can be filed with the court after the
person has disappeared for more than 7 years.

If the property owned is a HDB flat, existing flat owners may approach
the HDB Branch Office managing their HDB flat. You should check HDB’s
e-services for the appropriate branch.

You can be listed as a joint tenant if **all of the following** are
present:

1\. Unity of possession: Each tenant is entitled to full possession of
the entire property as any other joint tenant, and this means no single
joint tenant can point to a physical part of the land / house / flat and
claim it as his or her own

2\. Unity of interest: This means all tenants are entitled to one and the
same interest, and in general an interest cannot be shifted to anyone
else without all the joint tenants agreeing

3\. Unity of title: The interests of all joint tenants must be obtained
from the **same** document or transfer

4\. Unity of time: Joint tenants must obtain their interests **at the
same time**

The first two unities describe the rights of joint-tenants. The last two
unities describe what must be done for you to be listed as a
joint-tenant, ie. the names of two or more persons must be inscribed on
the title deed at the same time.

**What happens if a sole owner or tenant-in-common passes away?**

The remaining family or single occupier is allowed to retain the
existing flat after the owner has died if the remaining occupant is a
Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident, is at least 21 years old and
satisfies the Housing & Developing Board’s prevailing eligibility rules
and conditions to own a flat.[^5]

If the sole owner or tenant-in-common passes away leaving behind a will,
the deceased’s interest in the flat will be distributed according to the
will. The deceased’s family should engage a private solicitor to apply
to the courts for a Grant of Probate. The Grant of Probate is a court
order that gives the legal authority to the Executor to administer the
deceased’s estate. The person named in a will to administer the
deceased’s estate is known as an “Executor”.[^6]

If the sole owner or tenant-in-common passes away without leaving behind
a will, the deceased’s interest in the flat will be distributed
according to the provisions of the Intestate Succession Act. The
deceased’s family should engage a private solicitor to apply to the
courts for a Grant of Letters of Administration. The Grant of Letters of
Administration is a court order that gives the legal authority to the
Administrator to administer the deceased’s estate. The person
administering the deceased’s estate is known as an “Administrator”.[^7]

Once the Grant of Letters of Administration or the Grant of Probate has
been obtained, the Administrator(s) / Executor(s) can engage their own
solicitors or appoint HDB solicitors to act for them to register their
legal right as the Administrator(s) / Executor(s).

If they wish to engage the services of HDB, they can approach the HDB
Branch Office managing the deceased’s flat to make the necessary
application, bringing along the following documents:

-   Original copy of the Petition for the Grant of Letters of
    Administration/ Grant of Probate
-   Original copy of the Grant of Letters of Administration/ Grant of
    Probate;
-   original copy of the Syariah Court Inheritance Certificate (for
    Muslim Estates only)
-   A copy of death certificate of the deceased owner
-   Duplicate lease of the deceased’s flat
-   Identity Card(s)[^8]

The Administrator(s) / Executor(s) will have to sign the relevant
documents and pay the relevant fees, such as stamp fees, conveyancing
fees etc. Thereafter, the Administrator(s) / Executor(s) must apply at
the HDB Branch Office managing the deceased’s flat to transfer the flat
to the beneficiaries as owners, subject to HDB’s eligibility criteria
and conditions governing transfer of flat ownership”.[^9]

#### **3. “Landed” or non-“landed” property**

The Singaporean Government imposes strict rules on who can and cannot
purchase certain types of property in Singapore.

**Landed Property**

Under the Residential Property Act[^10], only Singapore citizens and
approved buyers can buy landed ‘residential property’. Restrictions are
imposed on foreign ownership of private residential property. A foreign
person means any person who is not any of the following:

-   A Singapore citizen;
-   A Singapore company;
-   A Singapore limited liability partnership; or
-   A Singapore society.[^11]

Foreigners are eligible to purchase units in condominiums or apartments
within a building.

**Housing & Development Board (HDB) Development**

If you are buying a HDB flat, you should check with HDB directly in
respect of the sale. The HDB has specific eligibility conditions and has
devised its own form of Sale and Purchase Agreement for the sale and
purchase of HDB flats.

**Joint ownership of HDB flat:** A HDB flat may be owned by two or more
persons as joint tenants or tenants-in-common. If parties wish to
convert the holding type of the flat, or change the proportion of shares
held in the flat, parties can either:

> a.  Appoint their own lawyers to act for them, or
> b.  Contact and engage HDB to handle the transaction.

#### **4. Area of house or flat**

You are advised to check with your lawyer the land area of the House /
floor area of the Flat. The land area of the House is different from the
built-up area of the House.

You may also want to consult a qualified surveyor if you suspect any
discrepancy in the boundary line or encroachment, or if you require the
actual area of the House or Flat.

#### **5. Financing**

**Total cost of buying the House or Flat**

Before you decide to buy a House or Flat you must check that you have
sufficient funds available to complete the purchase. You should check
and factor in the total cost of buying the House or Flat such as:

1.  **Cost of buying a House or Flat**
    -   Purchase price of the House or Flat.
    -   Buyer’s stamp duty on the Sale and Purchase Agreement or Option
        to Purchase.
    -   Additional buyer’s stamp duty (to be paid by certain groups of
        people who buy or acquire residential properties including
        residential land).
    -   Lawyer’s fees and disbursements.
    -   Valuation fees.
    -   Survey fees.
    -   Property agent’s commission.
    -   Other miscellaneous costs.
2.  **Cost of financing a House or Flat**
    -   CPF charges.
    -   CPF Board’s lawyer’s fees and disbursements.
    -   Fees charged by lender bank/finance company.
    -   Lender’s lawyer’s fees and disbursements.
    -   Stamp duty on loan/financing documents.
    -   Other miscellaneous costs.
3.  **Stamp duty (as well as additional stamp duty) on the purchase will
    have to be paid once the document is signed:**
    -   Within 14 days after the date of the document if the document is
        signed in Singapore; or
    -   Within 30 days after the date of its receipt in Singapore if the
        document is signed overseas.[^12]

Stamp duty is the tax imposed on certain legal documents, including
documents relating to immovable property such as a House / Flat.

If stamp duty is not paid within 14 or 30 days (whichever is
applicable), there will be penalties payable in addition to the stamp
duty amounof up to 4 times the due amount.[^13]

It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer in order to estimate
the total cost of buying a House or Flat.

You should also take into consideration other payments and charges that
may apply after buying a House or Flat, such as:

-   Monthly instalments required for repayment of loan from the lender
    bank or finance company.
-   Conservancy charges / management fees.
-   Fire insurance.
-   Mortgage term reducing insurance.
-   Property taxes.

**Financing the purchase of a House / Flat**

You should consider what types of financing are available to you, such
as:

-   Your income/salary
-   Savings in the form of cash and investments
-   Net sales proceeds (minus outstanding loan) from your current home,
    if any
-   Loan from Lender
-   Loan from HDB
-   CPF savings

You should contact the CPF Board and the Lender bank/finance company as
early as possible, preferably before you pay the upfront deposit. This
will allow you to sign all relevant application forms and furnish all
relevant information and documents in advance to ensure that the CPF
funds and/or loan will be approved and that the funds will be available.

**Loan from Lender**

You should contact the Lender as early as possible, preferably before
you pay the upfront deposit, to find out:

> 1.  The loan amount you are eligible for.
>
> 2\. The amount of monthly instalments required for repayment of the loan.

To find out more about loans, how interest is computed, how to compare
the different home loan packages, and other important information, you
can refer to the ABS-MoneySENSE guide *About Home Loans - Key Questions
to Ask the Bank Before Taking a Home Loan*.[^14]

**CPF savings**

If you are using CPF savings, you should work out your CPF withdrawal
limit before you pay the upfront deposit for the House or Flat. You can
utilise your CPF savings to help you pay for:

-   The purchase price.
-   

    The stamp duty, legal fees, incidental legal expenses and other

    :   related costs incurred in connection with the purchase of the
        House or Flat.

-   

    Monthly instalments for repayment of the loan. However, please note

    :   that there could be a mortgagee’s restriction on the use of your
        CPF savings towards servicing your housing loan[^15] or other
        issues that should be taken into account.

It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer in order to check the
possible use of your CPF savings when buying a House or Flat.

**6. Your marital status**[^16]

**Buying a HDB with your fiancé(e)**

Courting couples who intend to get married may apply to buy a HDB flat
under the Fiancé/Fiancée scheme.

**If your fiancé/fiancée is below 21 years old:** He or she can only be
listed as an occupier in the flat application.

**If your fiancé/fiancée is below 21 but above 18 years old:** Written
consent from parents or guardians must be submitted during the flat
selection appointment.

**If your fiancé/fiancée is below 18 years old:** A Special Marriage
Licence from the Ministry of Social and Family Development must be
submitted during the flat selection appointment.

**Prohibition of change in name during application**

**Fiancé(e)s:** While you are applying for a flat under the
Fiancé/Fiancée Scheme, you are not allowed to delete the name of your
fiancé/fiancée and include the name of a new fiancé/fiancée or to
replace the fiancé/fiancée’s name with that of your parents, even if
consent has been given by your ex-fiancé/fiancée.

**Single children and parents:** A single child who has applied with
his/her parents will not be allowed to delete the parents’ names if the
single child later includes his fiancé/ fiancée to qualify under this
scheme.

**Submission of marriage certificate**

**(a) If you are applying for the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) or
the Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG):** You must submit a copy of your
marriage certificate to the HDB on or before the date you take
possession of the flat as these housing grants are meant for married
couples.

If you have solemnised your marriage before you collect the keys to your
flat, you will have to submit a copy of your marriage certificate to the
HDB Sales Office.

**(b) If you are not applying for the AHG or the SHG and you have booked
a flat that is completed:** You must produce your marriage certificate
within three months after you have taken possession of the new flat.

**(c) If you are not applying for the AHG or the SHG and you have booked
a flat that is under construction:** You must produce your marriage
certificate at the estimated Delivery Possession Date of the flat or
within three months after you have taken possession of the new flat,
whichever is later.

**(d) If you solemnise your marriage after you have taken possession of
the new flat:** You will have to submit a copy of your marriage
certificate to the HDB Branch managing the lease of your flat.

### Your Lawyer’s Role in a Property Purchase

When you purchase property, your lawyer’s responsibilities include the
following:

**(a)** **Reviewing** the terms and conditions of the Option to Purchase
or the Sale and Purchase Agreement to ensure that your interest is
protected, and explaining the terms and conditions to you.

**(b)** **Advising** on the amount of stamp duty payable, and by what
date.

**(c)** **Conducting searches** on the title of the property to ensure
that you will be given the title to the property identified in the
contract and which you have negotiated to buy – this is extremely
important and you should make sure your lawyer carries out this step in
the soonest time practicable, so that appropriate action can be taken if
any defects in title are found.

**(d)** **Sending routine queries** to various government departments to
ensure that are no adverse regulatory notices or government schemes that
will affect the property that you wish to purchase.

**(e)** **Lodging a caveat** against the title to the property pending
completion of your purchase — this notifies the public (and any third
party interested in the property) that you have a valid interest or
claim to the title of the property arising from the contract.

**(f)** **Liaising with the bank’s lawyer** who is responsible for
preparing the mortgage to secure the loan, if you are using a loan to
finance the purchase. In some cases, your Lender may appoint your lawyer
to represent the Lender’s interest.

**(g)** **Liaising with the Lender and the CPF Board** (or their
lawyers) to ensure that your loan and your CPF funds are in place and
ready for drawdown in order to complete the purchase within the agreed
completion period.

**(h)** **“Completing the sale”**, this means the payment of the sale
price (from you as the Buyer) in exchange for the signed conveyance of
title called the “Instrument of Transfer” which effectively transfers
the ownership of the property from the current owners to yourself (as
the new owner). Your lawyer must also ensure that the
seller/transferor’s lawyer has filed a “notice of transfer” to notify
the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) within one month of
the property transfer.[^17]

**Legal Fees**

Note: The lawyer’s fees do not include stamp duty or disbursements
properly incurred by the lawyer.

Documents for Buying or Selling a House or Flat
-----------------------------------------------

**Option to Purchase or Sale and Purchase Agreement**

Generally, legal contracts for the sale and purchase of property take
the form of:

1.  An Option to Purchase (“OTP”) **or**
2.  A Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”)

A contract/agreement for the purchase of a House or Flat can be formed
in many ways, for example:

-   By correspondence
-   By the exercise of an OTP
-   By the parties signing a SPA

**Scope and content of OTPs and SPAs**

OTPs (which are often prepared by property agents) and SPAs are
documents that create legal rights and obligations, dealing particularly
with:

-   Title of the property
-   Mode of payment
-   Discharge of encumbrances
-   Schemes and other matters affecting the property (e.g. road
    widening)
-   Vacant possession or subject to tenancy
-   Completion date
-   Liability for property tax, maintenance fees or sinking fund
-   Delay in completion
-   Other related and special terms

**Before signing:** You should consult your lawyer before signing the
OTP or the SPA. This is to ensure that your interests are protected.

**Check whether the necessary terms have been included:** Whatever form
the legal contract takes, the following terms must be present in order
for the sale and purchase agreement to be legally enforceable:

1.  Identification of the property offered for sale
2.  Price of the property
3.  Completion Date
4.  The contract for the sale of the property must aso be in writing,
    and signed by the owner or his authorised representative

### The Law Society’s Conditions Of Sale

Most contracts for the sale and purchase of property in Singapore will
incorporate standard terms called the Singapore Law Society’s Conditions
of Sale 2012 (“2012 Conditions”). If the terms of the OTP or SPA are
silent on certain points, then the 2012 Conditions will apply. These
conditions may also be modified by express terms in the OTP or SPA.

### Types Of Legal Contracts For The Purchase Of Property

### **A. Option to Purchase (OTP)**

An OTP is a right or option given by the seller to the intending buyer
to purchase the property at a specified price within a certain period of
time. During an option period of typically 14 days, while the seller is
prevented from selling the property to any other person the buyer can
withdraw from the purchase.

Only the seller has to sign the OTP when it is granted. Usually the
buyer will pay the seller an option fee of 1% of the purchase price of
the property to secure the OTP. Note that the option fee is not
refundable to the buyer if he/she does not exercise the OTP during the
option period.

**Before obtaining the OTP:** You are advised to consult your lawyer
before paying the option fee and obtaining the OTP. Your lawyer will
investigate the title and advise you on the terms of the OTP before you
accept them by exercising the OTP.

**Exercising the OTP:** You will exercise the OTP during the option
period by signing the acceptance copy and returning this document
together with payment of a deposit (usually 5-10% of the purchase price
less the option fee you had paid earlier) to the seller. When exercised,
the OTP forms the contract between you and the seller. Almost all
options are expressly made subject to the Singapore Law Society’s
Conditions of Sale 2012.

**Preparing the OTP:** OTPs are often prepared by property agents. While
OTPs are adequate for the majority of transactions, it is always
advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer before you agree on the
terms of the OTP and part with any money. Checks can then be done on the
property before you pay the option fee.

### **B. Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA)**

Sometimes the seller will insist on entering into a SPA for the
property. If the buyer signs the SPA, unlike in the case of the OTP
**they will not have the option of changing their mind and refusing to
go ahead with the purchase**.

Likewise, the seller cannot refuse to sell the property to you if a SPA
is signed. The buyer often pays a deposit equivalent to 10% of the
purchase price when the SPA is signed. Unlike an OTP, both the buyer and
seller sign the SPA at the time the deposit is paid.

**2. Purchase from an Unlicensed Developer**

You are advised to consult your lawyer before paying the booking fee to
unlicensed developers. Unlicensed developers are not required to comply
with the Housing Developers (Licensing and Control) Act or its Rules.
The unlicensed developer is free to mortgage the land and there are no
statutory safeguards to ensure that the progress payments from the buyer
will be utilised to pay off the mortgage loan. In the event that the
unlicensed developer defaults in his mortgage payments or if he gets
into financial difficulties he may not be able to complete the
development.

Furthermore, you may face difficulties in obtaining approval to use your
CPF savings to buy a property, or in obtaining a mortgage from a bank or
finance company to finance your purchase of the House or Flat in view of
the risks involved.

Selling Your House or Flat
--------------------------

It is important to keep the following factors in mind when selling your
House / Flat:

1.  Whether to enter into an OTP or SPA
2.  Stakeholding

3\. Goods and Services Tax (GST) for properties with a *commercial*
component

4.  Whether your flat is a HDB flat (specific rules will apply)

**Option to Purchase or Sale and Purchase Agreement**

You can sell your House or Flat by:

1.  Granting an Option to Purchase (“OTP”) to the buyer **or**
2.  Entering into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with the buyer

For more information on the OTP or SPA see above.

**2. Stakeholding**

Your lawyers will normally hold the deposit paid on exercise of the OTP
or signing of the SPA, as stakeholders. This is to assure the buyer that
the deposit will be kept safely until completion of the purchase,
especially as the sale will normally be subject to:

-   The discharge of encumbrances like the mortgage and CPF charge
-   The title being in order
-   Satisfactory replies to legal requisitions sent to the various
    government departments

In certain circumstances, the Singapore Academy of Law will hold two
kinds of conveyancing money:

-   Stakeholding deposit
-   Conveyancing money (other than stakeholding deposit), i.e. the
    buyer’s or seller’s money to be used for settlement of the sale and
    purchase of the property[^18] until the expiry of the defects
    liability period provided in the SPA

**3. Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’)**

GST is not payable on residential property at present.[^19]

However, as some residential properties (e.g. a shop-house with a flat
above) may involve a commercial component, you should seek advice from
your lawyer on this as GST will be payable for the commercial component
of the property.

Your Lawyer’s Role in a Property Sale
-------------------------------------

When you sell property, your lawyer’s primary responsibility is to
ensure that on completion, you are ready to deliver the title to the
property free from encumbrances such as your mortgage and CPF charge.

This requires your lawyer to liaise with your bank and the CPF Board or
their lawyers for payment, out of the sale proceeds, of the outstanding
loan amount and refund of your CPF funds sufficient to discharge the
bank’s mortgage and the CPF charge.

Your lawyer shall also file a “notice of transfer” to notify the Inland
Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) within one month of the property
transfer.[^20]

Housing & Development Board Flats
---------------------------------

If you are selling your Housing & Development Board (“HDB”) flat, you
should contact HDB directly in respect of the sale. The HDB has specific
eligibility conditions and it has devised its own form of SPA for the
sale and purchase of HDB flats.

Commonly Asked Questions on Purchasing or Selling a House or Flat
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### General

**What is a private property?**

A private property is any property in Singapore that is **not** owned by
the Housing & Development Board (“HDB”) or the Jurong Town Corporation
(“JTC”). HDB and JTC properties have specific rules and regulations
which affect the sale and purchase of such properties.

**Can I check what the area of the property is?**

If you are buying a landed property, a title search done by your lawyer
will tell you what the land area is. However this will not tell you the
“built-up” area of the house.

If you buy a flat, the title search should tell you the built-up area of
the flat. However for some old flats that have not been issued with
strata titles, the areas stated in the title searches and documents are
only estimates.

Properties that you are buying from developers are unlikely to have
title documents issued yet. Thus, the only way to check the area of the
property is from the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

**I am not a Singapore Citizen. Are there any restrictions on me buying
a residential property?**

Yes, the Residential Property Act sets forth restrictions on foreign
ownership of private residential property in Singapore. However, these
restrictions do not apply if you are buying a non-restricted residential
property. According to Section 4(1) of the Residential Property Act,
non-restricted residential property includes:

-   Any flat (including any share in land appurtenant to that flat) that
    is comprised in any building in a development permitted to be used
    under the Planning Act (Cap. 232)
-   Any unit comprised in a development which is shown in an approved
    plan bearing the title “condominium” and issued by the competent
    authority under the Planning Act, **and**
-   Any unit in a development comprising of housing accommodation sold
    under the executive condominium scheme established under the
    Executive Condominium Housing Scheme Act (Cap. 99A)

As used in Singapore, “condominium” has a very specific meaning. Title
documents for condominiums have the word “condominium” printed on the
top of the document. Many developments that have swimming pool and other
facilities normally found in condominiums are not in fact classified as
condominiums.

If you intend to buy a landed property or a flat in a building that is
below 6 storeys, you must apply to the Controller of Residential
Properties for approval. Singapore Permanent Residents must also seek
approval if they are buying such properties.

If you or any of your co-buyers is not a Singapore citizen, you should
seek the advice of a lawyer before committing to a purchase. The Sale
and Purchase Agreement or the Option to Purchase must allow for the
approval from the Controller of Residential Properties if such approval
is required. Failure to do so will render the Sale and Purchase
Agreement or the OTP illegal and voidand you may not be able to obtain a
refund of the deposit.

**Which should I do first, find a property or check with the banks?**

This will depend on your circumstances. If you have adequate financing
then you can start looking for a property . However, if you need
financing/a loan, it would be prudent to find out from the bank(s) the
loan amount you are eligible for and the amount of monthly instalments
required for repayment of the loan, before paying the option fee or
signing an OTP or SPA.

For the average buyer, securing financing will depend on factors
including your financial situation, age, available Central Provident
Funds (“CPF”) savings and the amount of cash you can raise for your
initial deposit. With this information, you will be able to concentrate
your search for a property in the right price range. When you find a
property you like, you should check with the banks once again to ensure
that the property is not over-priced.

**What are the Singapore Law Society’s Conditions of Sale 2012?**

These refer to a set of standard terms and conditions which the buyer
and seller may wish to incorporate by reference to standard contracts
for the sale and purchase of immovable properties. Parties may however
contract out of the 2012 Conditions or any particular Condition by
providing their own terms and conditions in the contracts, where
appropriate, to meet the particular circumstances of their
transaction.[^21]

It is usual for any sale and purchase of property in Singapore to be
made subject to these conditions. You should be able to obtain a copy of
these conditions from your lawyer.

If the terms of the SPA or the OTP are silent on certain points, then
the provisions of the 2012 Conditions will apply. These conditions may
also be modified by express terms in the SPA or OTP.

**What are some of the things that I have to pay for, other than the
purchase price of the property?**

Assuming that you are taking a loan and utilising your Central Provident
Fund (“CPF”) savings for your purchase, you will have to ensure that you
have funds for the following:

1\. Bank loan processing fee (the amount varies from bank to bank and
some banks may not charge / will waive this fee).

2.  Stamp duty on the SPAor OTP and on the loan documents.

3\. Legal fees for your lawyers, the bank’s lawyers, the CPF Board’s
lawyers and incidental legal expenses.

4\. Incidental expenses that have to be settled (refer to Chapter
17.1.1(e)).

You can utilise your CPF savings to help you pay for:

1.  The purchase price.

2\. The stamp duty, legal fees, incidental legal expenses and other
related costs incurred in connection with the purchase of the
House/Flat.

3\. Monthly instalments for repayment of the loan. However, please note
that there could be a mortgagee’s restriction on the use of your CPF
savings towards servicing your housing loan[^22] or other issues that
should be taken into account. It is advisable to seek the assistance of
a lawyer in order to check the possible use of the CPF savings for this
purpose.

**Do I have to pay commission for an incomplete property sale?**

You have no obligation to pay any commission if the completion of the
property transaction fails through no fault onyour part as the buyer .
If you enter into a binding agreement for sale and purchase of a
residential property with a seller introduced by an estate agent, you
will have to pay the estate agent commission which is a percentage of
the purchase price as indicated in the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

### Sale and Purchase Of HDB Flats

**Who can apply for a HDB loan to finance their purchase of resale
flats?**

Buyers can apply for a HDB loan if they and/or their essential
occupiers\*:

-   Have at least one buyer who is a Singapore Citizen
-   Have average gross monthly household income not exceeding:

    > a.  \$10,000 for families
    > b.  \$15,000 for extended families
    >
    > c\. \$5,000 for singles buying a 5-room or smaller resale flat or 2-room
    > new flat in a non-mature estate under the Single Singapore Citizen
    > scheme
    >
    > (Note that if the applicants and occupiers are unemployed for
    > fewer than 3 months, the average income will be computed based on
    > the number of actual months worked)
    >
    > **AND** submit HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) applications for the
    > purchase of new flats, purchase of resale flats, and transfer of
    > flat ownership (refer to the HDB InfoWEB page for more details on
    > this)

-   Have not previously taken two or more HDB concessionary interest
    rate loans;
-   Do not own any private residential property in Singapore or
    overseas, which includes Housing and Urban Development Company
    (HUDC) flats and Executive Condominiums (ECs)
-   Have not disposed of any private residential property (includes
    HUDCs and ECs) within 30 months before the date of application for
    HLE and have never taken any HDB concessionary interest rate loan
-   Do not own more than one market / hawker stalls or commercial /
    industrial property in Singapore or overseas

\*Essential occupiers are family members who are required to be listed
in the Application Form in order to form a family nucleus so that the
buyer (the applicant) can qualify under the eligibility scheme to
purchase a resale flat.

You are advised to check the HDB InfoWEB for the most updated
eligibility conditions for HDB concessionary loans.[^23]

**What are my options if I want to buy a HDB flat but am still part of a
nuclear family due to my having been adopted?**

Your being adopted does not affect your legal status as part of the
family nucleus in question. But do note that if you are an essential
occupier (see above), this means that your leaving the occupancy of the
original HDB flat will affect the eligibility of its ownership for your
remaining family members.

**Can I sell a property on someone else’s behalf?**

If you have been granted with a valid power of attorney.

**How can I sell the HDB flat in case the joint owner objects?**

You cannot unilaterally sell a HDB flat held under joint ownership with
another.

However, you can sever your joint tenancy and convert it into
tenancy-in-common. You and the other joint-owner(s) will then hold the
flat in equal shares (e.g. 50%), under which you can seek to sell your
own share of the HDB flat without requiring the agreement of the other
joint owner(s). Do note, however, that you must have fulfilled the
Minimum Occupation Period before being eligible to sell your flat.
Please consult Chapter 17.1.1 or the detailed FAQs below for more
information on the severance of the joint-tenancy.

**How do I complete a property sale where seller and buyer are
related?**

The seller and buyer can proceed according to normal resale procedures
related to HDB flats.

Alternatively, a flat owner may sell his/her share of the flat ownership
to other family members under the Resale part-share scheme, subject to
the buyers meeting HDB’s eligibility schemes and eligibility criteria.
Resale part-share refers to a change of flat ownership by way of a
partial sale/purchase between family members at a mutually agreed price.
Monetary consideration is involved for such change in ownership.[^24]
The minimum occupation period of the flat must also have been met.
However, resale part-share is not allowed between married couples. For
more information, please contact HDB.

**Do I need a solicitor to handle the resale transaction of my HDB
flat?**

Yes.

HDB provides conveyancing services for normal resale transactions. These
services are available to buyers regardless of whether they are getting
a loan from HDB or commercial banks/financial institutions.

You may also engage your own solicitor to handle the conveyancing. You
need to produce a letter from your solicitor to confirm that they are
acting for you in the conveyancing of the resale transaction when you
submit your resale application to HDB or when you attend the resale
first appointment.

**How do I remove a caveat on my flat?**

A caveat may be challenged and removed if there are grounds to do so, by
filing a removal of caveat with the Registrar.

Letting / Renting a Property
----------------------------

### Documents Required For Letting / Renting a Property

Most landlords and tenants will engage the help of a professional
property agent to assist them and to protect their interest. The
property agent will usually prepare the Letter of Intent (“LOI”) and
Tenancy Agreement for the landlord and the tenant if the Landlord and
Tenant agree to let/rent the property.

**Document 1: Letter of Intent**

The tenant offers to rent the property from the landlord based on the
terms and conditions set out in the LOI by signing the LOI and paying a
good faith deposit. The landlord may either accept or reject the offer.
The tenant and landlord generally have a period to negotiate and agree
on the terms of the tenancy agreement, usually 7 days.

The LOI may include provisions such as:

-   Period of lease
-   Date of commencement
-   Terms of payment
-   Utilities and payment for other charges
-   Tenancy Agreement and stamping of tenancy
-   Diplomatic clause (usually included if the lease is more than a
    year)
-   Good faith deposit
-   Property agent’s fees

**Document 2: Tenancy Agreement**

The rights and obligations of the landlord and tenant will be set out in
the Tenancy Agreement.

The Tenancy Agreement may include provisions such as:

-   Period of lease
-   Date of commencement
-   Terms of payment
-   Payment of rent, deposit and return of deposit
-   Utilities and payment for other charges
-   Maintenance of unit, including air conditioners, repairs and payment
    in excess of amount stipulated for repairs
-   Diplomatic clause
-   Stamp duty

**Commission Fees**

Each property agent/agency may charge different commission/fees, so you
should check with the property agent what the commission is before you
engage him/her. Both the landlord and tenant should ensure that an
invoice from the licensed property agent’s agency is issued to them.

Subletting of an *Entire* HDB Flat

HDBflats sold under the Home Ownership Scheme are meant for
owner-occupation by the flat owners and their families. However, flat
owners who are Singapore Citizens may sublet their whole flat if they
meet HDB’s eligibility conditions under the Subletting of Flat/Bedroom
Scheme, such as prior approval from HDB.

5.  Tenancy / property ownership status
6.  Period of subletting
7.  Fees and costs
8.  Application for approval
9.  Flat owner’s responsibilities
10. Proof of ownership of flat

website[^26] or their Employment Pass and “S” Pass validity on the
Ministry of Manpower’s website.[^27]

**Non-Citizen Subletting Quota**

Subletting of a flat to one or more non-Malaysian non-citizens is
subject to the Non-Citizen (NC) Subletting Quota. The NC subletting
quota is set at 8% and 11% at the neighbourhood and block level
respectively. It applies to subtenants who are PRs and foreigners, but
not to Malaysians.

When the NC Subletting Quota in a neighbourhood and/or block is reached,
flat owners there cannot apply to sublet their flat to any non-Malaysian
NCs. They can only sublet their flat to Singaporeans and Malaysians.
Flat owners can use the e-Service on the HDB InfoWEB to enquire if their
flat can be sublet to non-Malaysian NCs.[^28]

The NC Subletting Quota does not apply to subletting of bedrooms.

**3. Minimum occupation period**

Flat owners may sublet their flat if they have met the minimum
occupation period (“MOP”) as follows:

    flat/bedroom from another flat owner, failing which, they must
    resume occupation of their own flat

Subtenants must not be owners of Executive Condominium units where the
5-year minimum occupation period has not been met.

**6. Period of subletting**

**Minimum period**

Flat owners are not allowed to sublet the flat on a short-term basis.
The period of subletting to each subtenant per application must not be
less than 6 months.

**Maximum period**

The maximum subletting period allowed is 3 years per application or as
indicated in the approval letter, whichever is shorter. However, for
subletting involving non-Malaysian NC subtenants, the period of
subletting per application is 1.5 years or as indicated in the approval
letter, whichever is shorter. NCs refer to Singapore Permanent Residents
and foreigners. Flat owners are required to apply each time they sublet
your flat or when they renew the subletting tenancy.

**Computation of MOP for other purposes**

The period of subletting will not be included in computing the requisite
MOP/time bar to determine the flat owner’s eligibility to:

-   Resell the flat in the open market;
-   Invest in a private residential property

    > Not applicable if the flat sublet is a resale flat bought from
    > open market without a CPF Housing Grant and the application for
    > the purchase of the flat was received by HDB before 30 Aug 2010)

-   Apply for another flat directly from HDB (not applicable if the flat
    sublet is a resale flat bought from the open market without a CPF
    Housing Grant)

Owners who have sublet their flats will have to satisfy the full
requisite occupation period/time bar specified by HDB before they are
eligible for any of the above.

**7. Fees and costs**

flat owner’s eligibility to sublet his/her flat and the NC Subletting
Quota.

**Withdrawal of Service & Conservacy Charge (S&CC) Rebate**

As part of the Goods and Services Tax offset package, the Government
granted the Service & Conservancy Charge (S&CC) rebate to eligible
citizen households. However, lessees who sublet their flat will not be
eligible for the rebate during the period of subletting.[^29]

**8. Application for approval**

You must obtain HDB’s approval before you sublet your whole flat. You
can submit the application online at HDB’s *MyHDBPage*.[^30]
Alternatively, you can obtain the application form online or from any
HDB Branch.

If the flat owner is overseas during the subletting period, there must
be a properly appointed attorney to act for him in the management of the
flat. A certified true copy of the Power of Attorney (POA), prepared in
accordance with HDB's standard format and which has been lodged with the
High Court, must be furnished. You are advised to consult your lawyer on
the POA.

**9. Flat owner’s responsibilities**

As a flat owner subletting your flat, you will be responsible for making
sure that:

-   The flat is sublet to eligible subtenants only.
-   There is no overcrowding and the number of subtenants does not
    exceed the maximum number allowed.
-   Your subtenants have entered and are remaining in Singapore lawfully
    at all times (while the subletting is ongoing).
-   Your subtenants do not further sublet the flat to other persons; and
-   Your subtenants comply with all the covenants in the lease and the
    provisions of the Housing & Development Act and that you are
    responsible for all infringements, if any, committed by them.

As a flat owner subletting your flat, you will also be responsible for:

-   Informing the Comptroller of Property Tax, of the subletting
    approval and termination of subletting.
-   Informing HDB of any changes in the subletting agreement.
-   Resuming occupation of your flat and ensuring your subtenants vacate
    the premises when the subletting is terminated, or when you are no
    longer eligible to sublet your flat.
-   Surrendering the flat if it is repossessed by HDB.

**10. Proof of ownership of flat**

Subtenants are advised to visit the flat that they intend to rent and
ensure that the person whom you are dealing with is the rightful owner
of the flat. You can do so by requesting for documentary proof of flat
ownership such as the Agreement for Lease, Service & Conservancy charges
booklet, Annual or Loan instalment payment booklet/Annual Loan
statements which should state the name of the flat owner.

**11. Rent payment and deposit**

The market practice is for rent to be paid on a monthly basis. The first
payment should be made on the day the tenancy commences, while
subsequent payments should be made on the same day of each subsequent
month.

The deposit amount is usually equal to one month’s rent for a one-year
tenancy contract, and two months’ rent for a two-year tenancy contract.
This is payable upon signing the tenancy agreement, together with the
first month’s advance rent. You are advised not to pay more than one
month’s rent.

For proof of payment, you should pay the rental deposit and rents by
cheque. You are also advised to move into the flat immediately after
collecting the keys.

**12. Disputes between subtenants and flat owners**

Matters relating to subletting tenancy such as the rental amount,
payment/forfeiture of deposits, right to terminate tenancy, subletting
periods, etc. are private matters between owners and their subtenants.
HDB will not mediate disputes between owners and their subtenants on
these matters. Hence, flat owners and subtenants are advised to read
carefully and understand all the terms and conditions in the tenancy
agreement before signing it.

Commonly Asked Questions on Letting and Subletting
--------------------------------------------------

### **FOR LANDLORDS**

**What are my rights as a landlord?**

Your rights are provided in the Tenancy Agreement. This includes:

a.  Having rent paid on time.

    > b\. Having repairs made and paid for where damage other than normal
    > wear-and-tear was caused by the tenant or their guests.

b.  Not having the property used for any purpose other than residential.

d\. Allowing the landlord or the landlord’s agent to enter the premises
for specific purposes, including inspection, repairs and maintenance.

e\. Returning the premises to the landlord in its original condition,
which includes having all repairs done, walls repainted, curtains and
appliances thoroughly cleaned, and any installations removed unless an
agreement was made with the landlord for these to remain.

If the tenant does not fulfil the minimum period of stay as stipulated
in the Tenancy Agreement, the tenant must pay the landlord the amount of
agreed rent, unless the tenant or the landlord is able to find a
replacement that does not cause the landlord to suffer a loss in rental.

It is essential to carefully draft the Tenancy Agreement to deal with
situations, specifically breaches of contractual terms, which allow the
landlord to evict a tenant. General provisions pertaining to landlord
and tenant relations are mentioned in the Civil Law Act, Distress Act,
Evidence Act and several other laws. However, there is no specific law
that governs the landlord-tenant relationship. Therefore, the court will
look at the Tenancy Agreement to see if the landlord’s actions of
evicting the tenant are in accordance with the agreement.

**I have sublet my flat to subtenants. If there is misuse of the flat
during the period of subletting (for e.g. using the flat as a gambling
den), who will be held responsible?**

You, as flat owner, are responsible for the compliance with all the
covenants in the lease and the provisions of the Housing & Development
Act, in case of any infringement committed by the subtenants during the
period of the subletting.

**I would like to let someone else stay in my flat without collecting
rent from them, while my family and I stay elsewhere. Is this allowed?**

You, as flat owner, may allow your relatives/friends to stay in your
flat temporarily. However, you and your family must continue to stay in
the flat during the period when your relatives/friends are staying
there.

Unauthorised subletting of flat is an infringement of the lease. HDB
takes a serious view of such infringements and will not hesitate to take
strong action against those who flout the rules. Unauthorised subletting
of a flat includes instances where owners sublet one or more bedrooms
while they do not live in the flat during the period of subletting,
instead keeping one room locked while coming back only occasionally. HDB
can repossess the flat of those who commit such infringements, or impose
a penalty against them.

**I own a private property and would like to reside there and sublet my
HDB flat. Is this allowed?**

Yes. This is subject to HDB’s eligibility conditions (please refer to
the previous sections).

**I have locked up one room and sublet the remaining rooms to subtenants
while my family and I stay elsewhere. Is this a violation of HDB’s
subletting policy?**

Yes, it is a violation.

Locking up one room and subletting the remaining ones while you and your
family stay elsewhere is deemed as unauthorised subletting of the whole
flat and, therefore, an infringement of the lease. HDB can repossess the
flat and/or impose a penalty against you.

HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. If you sublet your rooms (and
not the entire flat) to subtenants, you and your family must continue to
stay in the flat with the subtenants during the period of subletting.

**Can Executive Condominium (EC) owners sublet rooms in their EC
units?**

Yes.

No prior approval from HDB is required if you rent out your bedroom(s)
in the EC within the minimum occupation period.

**Registration and notification:** However, you must register the
subletting of bedrooms with HDB within 7 days of doing so. You are also
required to notify HDB when you renew or terminate the subletting of
bedrooms, and when there are changes to your subtenants’ particulars.
You may approach the HDB Branch managing your EC to register the
subletting.

**A subtenant left 2 days into a 1-month agreement. Am I required to
return the deposit paid?**

You should check your Tenancy Agreement for the terms between the
landlord and yourself. There are no standard terms regarding the
pre-mature termination of lease. The terms can be drawn up in the
Agreement depending on what is mutually agreed upon by both parties. The
deposit should be refunded upon termination of the Agreement in under
certain stipulated events.

### **FOR TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS: GENERAL**

**What are my rights as a tenant?**

**Rights under the Tenancy Agreement:** A tenant is entitled to a copy
of the Tenancy Agreement which usually states the tenant’s rights. For
example, the landlord must fulfil the minimum stated period of rental at
the agreed price and must compensate the tenant for any major repairs.

Tenants also have the rights to clean premises in good state of repair,
reasonable security with locks in good working order, and vacant
possession at the commencement of the lease.

**Rights under common law:** Additionally, the common law will imply
certain rights even if these are not specifically provided in the lease
agreement. Some examples are the implied covenants for quiet enjoyment
of the premises, which means that you can enjoy the use of the premises
without interference. Other implied covenants are that there shall be no
derogation from the grant. That means all the terms granted to you must
be fully observed by the landlord. The implied covenant for good title
and possession of the premises for the fixed term is= another. As long
as the fixed term given has not expired, the original parties to the
lease agreement have to fulfil their respective obligations.

**What if my landlord sells his Flat / House while I am still a tenant
and the Tenancy Agreement has not yet expired?**

Even if a landlord has sold or transferred his interest in the freehold
or the remainder of whatever rights he may have in the property, the
buyer or successor-in-title shall be bound to observe the terms of the
lease granted to the tenant (Section 11, Conveyancing and Law of
Property Act).

If the landlord wants to evict the tenant before the minimum stated
period of rental is up, the tenant may find a comparable rental and sue
the landlord for the extra rent paid at the new rental premises.

**As a prospective subtenant, how do I know whether an HDB owner is
eligible to sublet his flat?**

Singapore Citizens who wish to sublet their whole flat are required to
obtain the written approval from HDB. Hence, you may request the flat
owner to show you a copy of the approval letter from HDB to rent out
their flat. To protect your interest, you are also advised to include a
condition in the subletting contract, specifying that the validity of
the contract is subject to the flat owner obtaining HDB’s approval for
the subletting.

**I intend to rent a flat. How do I know whether the person I am dealing
with is the owner of the flat that I will be renting?**

You can do so by requesting the person you are dealing with to show you
documentary evidence of flat ownership, such as:

(a) Agreement for Lease
(b) Service & Conservancy charges booklet
(c) Annual or Loan instalment payment booklet / Annual Loan statements

The name of the flat owner should be stated in the above documents.

**How can I enforce a verbal agreement with my landlord?**

A verbal agreement cannot be enforced unless sufficient evidence is
provided to prove its existence (Section 6(b), Civil Law Act).

An oral agreement for a lease coupled with part performance will also
render the lease enforceable, however, payment of a rental deposit will
be insufficient. The tenant’s part performance will have had to be a
clear act to demonstrate evidence of an agreement to rent to premises,
such as making renovations.

**What can I do with a landlord who doesn’t honour an agreement?**

You will need to refer to the Tenancy Agreement when disputes arise.
There is no specific law that governs the landlord-tenant relationship.

**Clauses in the Tenancy Agreement:** it is essential to carefully draft
a Tenancy Agreement that specifies particular situations, which allows
the non-breaching party either to claim compensation or to terminate the
Tenancy Agreement. For example, where a clause requiring the landlord to
maintain the property is not being honoured, there may be a
corresponding terminating clause stating that where the landlord refuses
to maintain the property, the tenant may give notice of intent to
terminate the lease agreement prematurely unless the landlord complies
within a stipulated time frame. The clause may state further that if the
landlord still refuses, the tenant may terminate the lease without
consequence and have his deposit returned.

**Contract Law Principles:** Where no such clauses exist, the principles
of contract law apply.

> **Material breach:** to be able to terminate a contract there must be
> a “material breach” of contract causing damages which allows the
> non-breaching party to terminate the Tenancy Agreement. There is no
> strict definition of “material breach”, the courts considering the
> circumstances of each case and consequences resulting from the breach.
> As such a carefully drafted Tenancy Agreement specifying the types of
> conduct that will constitute a “material breach” is crucial.
>
> **Minor breach:**Where the breach is a minora tenant may be able to
> pursue damages at the Small Claims Tribunal, but it is recommended
> that both parties try to negotiate first. A minor breach does not
> excuse the tenant from fulfilling his/her contractual duties (such as
> paying rent).

**Resolution of Contractual Issues:** You may consider legal arbitration
or litigation in civil court to resolve this contractual issue.
Arbitration is a method by which the concerned parties agree to resolve
their differences out of court. This process involves a law counsel, who
is also known as an arbitrator. Both parties abide by the judgment
passed and follow the settlement accordingly. If either of the parties
does not agree for out-of-court settlements, then the breach of contract
is made into a civil case.

**The landlord and co-tenant have changed the locks on the unit I rent
-what are my rights?**

**Rights in the Tenancy Agreement:** You should check your Tenancy
Agreement for the terms between the landlord and yourself. Subject to
certain stated conditions (e.g. late payment of rental, lack of
performance with regards to any other condition), the landlord is
usually obliged to ensure that you can peaceably hold and enjoy the flat
during the lease term without any interruption from him.

**Implied Rights:** Additionally, the common law will imply certain
rights even if these are not specifically provided in the lease
agreement. An important implied covenant states that there shall be no
derogation from the grant. Barring any fault on your part, hanging the
locks on the unit you rent to prevent you from gaining entry could be
seen as an infringement of this condition.

**I gave notice to terminate a lease agreement because renovation works
in the HDB block made the premises unsuitable for occupation. Am I
liable to pay the rent for the remainder of the lease agreement?**

You should check your Tenancy Agreement for the conditions under which
your lease agreement may be terminated prematurely. Your rights to quiet
enjoyment are usually provided or implied into the lease agreement. This
protects your right to use and enjoy the premises without interference.

If the renovation works are of a nature and degree that interferes with
this right, you may be able to terminate the agreement prematurely. You
will need to contact a legal representative for more specific advice
based on the exact circumstances.

**I have signed a 1-year Tenancy Agreement. Can I back out of this
Agreement? What if I find a replacement tenant?**

In the event you have negotiated an exit clause in your tenancy
agreement, you can terminate the agreement whenever you want subject to
the terms of the exit clause. Please note that this is not a standard
clause and you should include it in the Tenancy Agreement.

**Note:** Please also consider that the landlord will usually insert a
reimbursement clause, therefore, in the event of early termination of
the Tenancy Agreement you are required to refund the commissions due by
the landlord to the agent.

**I am a subtenant and terminating my lease early. I am now being asked
to pay the agent fee by the main tenant. Do I have to pay?**

You should check your Tenancy Agreement for the terms between the
landlord and yourself. There are no standard terms regarding the
premature termination of lease. The terms can be drawn up in the
Agreement depending on what is mutually agreed upon by both parties.
Please consider that it is likely that the landlord has requested and
inserted a reimbursement clause under which you should refund the
commissions the landlord has paid to the agent.

**What is the required notice period for a 12-month lease agreement?**

You should check your Tenancy Agreement for the terms between the
landlord and yourself as there are no standard terms regarding the
premature termination of lease.

**Diplomatic Clause:** Many tenancy agreements contain a Diplomatic
Clause, which is a provision protecting the tenant in the event that
he/she loses his job or is transferred overseas by his employer. This
allows him/her to break the lease by giving a one-month notice period
upon completion of one year. However, the tenant must furnish sufficient
proof of relocation or job loss by providing a letter from the company.
This provision is usually applicable only in the case of a two-year
lease, but if the landlord is agreeable, it could have been included in
a one-year lease agreement.

**My landlord terminated my lease agreement with 1-month’s notice but
did not provide the stipulated compensation for doing so. How do I
recover my money?**

You should check your Tenancy Agreement for the terms between the
landlord and yourself as there are no standard terms regarding the
premature termination of lease.

However, if your landlord is supposed to provide you with compensation
for termination with only one month’s notice and consistently refuses to
do so despite your requests, you may have a legal claim against him.
Contact a legal representative for advice on taking action against him.

**I have been in default of rental payments for 2 months – what should I
do?**

There should be a grace period in your Tenancy Agreement, after which
your landlord has the right to re-enter the premises and issue a letter
to demand for payment (possibly with interest). Your landlord may also
want you to vacate the premises.

You should speak to your landlord to explain yourself (if there are any
extenuating circumstances). If this is the first time you have made late
rent payments and you have upheld all other conditions in the Agreement,
your landlord probably will not want to lose your tenancy and might be
able to work out an arrangement with you. You should also speak to your
bank and/or any legal representatives to ensure that you are in a
position to pay your rent as soon as possible.

**I entered into a Tenancy Agreement in which I was the occupier and
another person was the main tenant. The main tenant forced me to move
out. What are my legal rights?**

You should check the terms in your Tenancy Agreement. Subject to certain
stated conditions (e.g. late payment of rental, lack of performance with
regards to any other condition), the landlord is usually obliged to
ensure that you can peaceably hold and enjoy the flat during the lease
term without any interruption from him. If not specifically stated the
common law implies the clause that there shall be no derogation from the
grant. Barring any fault on your part, being forced to move out could be
seen as an infringement of this condition.

### **FOR TENANTS AND SUBTENANTS: RECOVERING YOUR DEPOSIT**

**I paid a deposit for a room but have changed my mind. Can I recover my
deposit in full or in part?**

The good faith deposit is a token deposit, usually one month’s rent and
is non-refundable. Hence, it is important to be absolutely sure on your
decision to rent a particular property to avoid forfeiting the good
faith deposit.

**How can I terminate the agreement / recover my deposit? Can I recover
the agent fee?**

You should check your Tenancy Agreement for the terms between the
landlord and yourself. The deposit should be refunded upon termination
of the agreement under certain stipulated events (e.g. HDB revoking its
consent to the subletting).

You usually cannot recover the agent fee.

**I paid a deposit to a landlord and subsequently found out that the
bank has repossessed the property. How do I recover my deposit?**

You should check your Tenancy Agreement for the terms between the
landlord and yourself. The deposit should be refunded upon termination
of the agreement under certain stipulated events (e.g. repossession of
property by HDB or a bank). You should not only be able to recover your
deposit, but also be able to claim additional compensation as stated in
the agreement (e.g. for transportation costs). You should contact your
landlord to provide him with an opportunity to repay your deposit before
commencing legal action.

**The head tenant sublet to me in breach of the HDB Regulations. I want
to move out, how do I recover my deposit?**

You should check your Tenancy Agreement for the terms between the
landlord and yourself. The deposit should be refunded upon termination
of the Agreement in under certain stipulated events (e.g. HDB revoking
its consent to the subletting).

You are likely able to be recover your deposit, and also claim
additional compensation as stated in the Agreement (e.g. for
transportation costs).

**I have a verbal sub-tenancy agreement evidenced by SMS/text message.
The head tenant will not return my deposit. How do I recover my
deposit?**

You should contact your head tenant to provide him with an opportunity
to repay your deposit first before commencing legal action. In the
situation where he repeatedly refuses to return the deposit, you may
have a claim for legal action against him provided that you can prove
the existence of your verbal agreement with sufficient evidence (e.g.
part performance by the tenant, written evidence, SMS).

**I am invoking the diplomatic clause in my tenancy agreement. How can I
ensure that my deposit is returned to me?**

Please check your Tenancy Agreement if you have met the agreed
requirements for a return of your deposit (e.g. minimum time period for
giving notice/elapsed). If you believe that you are entitled to your
deposit but your landlord consistently refuses to refund it to you
despite attempts at negotiation, you may have a legal claim against him
and you should seek legal advice.

However, do consider that the diplomatic clause usually includes a
reimbursement clause granting the landlord the refund of the commission
the landlord has paid to his agent.

**I signed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to rent a property and paid a
deposit. The possession date was then delayed for a month so I did not
want to sign the lease. How do I recover my deposit?**

Typically, if the tenant fails to execute the Tenancy Agreement before
the proposed commencement date set out in the LOI, the good faith
deposit will be forfeited to the landlord. But as there are no standard
terms relating to this, you should check your LOI for any specific
terms. Careful drafting is thus important for the LOI.

Recourse for Landlords, Enforcement Proceedings
-----------------------------------------------

If your tenant fails to pay rent, you have several options as landlord,
including:

1.  A distress action
2.  An action to sue for arrears of rent
3.  Forfeiture of the lease

### Distress Action[^36]

A distress action allows the landlord to go into the premises to seize
goods up to the value of the rents owed, in order to compel the tenant
to pay up.

However, the tenant must be given a stipulated (and reasonable) time to
recover his goods by paying up all arrears. Only failing this can the
landlord can sell the goods and recover the rent owed. Any balance must
be returned to the tenant.

**Writ of distress**

A landlord or his authorised agent may apply to the court for an order
for the issue of a writ of distress for the recovery of rent due by a
tenant of any premises for a period not exceeding 12 completed months of
the tenancy immediately preceding the date of the application.

**Step 1: Filing a writ of distress**

The procedure starts with the filing of a writ of distress that is
addressed to the Sheriff. The Sheriff will seize the movable goods or
belongings on the property, and make an inventory and a valuation. The
tenant will be given a notice of the seizure, informing him of the rent
owed and that the goods seized will be sold at a stated place and time.

**Notice requirement**: If the tenant is not on the premises, such
notice may be given to any person in occupation thereof or by posting it
in some conspicuous place. The tenant has 5 days to pay up from the date
of notice or apply to a judge to restrain the execution of the writ, or
to release any part of the property seized.

**Step 2: Judicial determination**

The judge may deal with the matter summarily and dismiss the application
or discharge the writ, or order the release of any property seized, or
may direct an issue to be tried and, pending the determination of such
issue, suspend the execution of the writ, or may order the property to
be sold and the proceeds of sale to be lodged in court and the proceeds
applied first to pay the sheriff's costs and then to satisfy the
outstanding rent.

The balance, if any, will be returned to the tenant.

**NOTE: Property exempted from seizure**

1.  Things in actual use and in the hands of a person at the time of the
    seizure.
2.  Tools and implements not in use where there is other movable
    property in or upon the house or premises sufficient to cover such
    amount and costs.
3.  The tenant’s necessary wearing apparel and necessary bedding for
    himself and his family.
4.  Goods in the possession of the tenant for the purpose of being
    carried, wrought, worked up, or otherwise dealt with in the course
    of his ordinary trade or business.
5.  Goods belonging to guests.
6.  Goods in the custody of the law.

### Suit For Arrears Of Rent

Statutory Limitation: This action must be brought within **6 years** of
the date when the arrars became due.

Rent owed is a debt and is therefore recoverable by simply suing the
tenant on the contract. The claim will be a specific sum, i.e. the rent
owed plus interest as the court thinks fit.

**Process:**

1.  Legal proceedings are begun via a writ of summons.
2.  The tenant must then enter appearance by filing a Memorandum of
    Appearance within 8 days of the date of service of the writ.
    Otherwise, judgment may be entered against him in default of
    appearance.
3.  Thereafter, the tenant will have to file a Defence to the claim, if
    any, within 14 days. If he does not, or if he has no Defence under
    the law, the landlord may then apply for judgment to be entered
    against him in default of Defence.

### Forfeiture Of Lease

The landlord may also apply for forfeiture of the lease, i.e.
effectively bring the lease to an end. This is often an action for
possession, and a well-drafted agreement will usually contain a clause
for re-entry in the event of the tenant's failure to pay rent.

**Process:**

1.  A landlord can obtain possession of the premises either by effecting
    a peaceable entry or by process of law. This must be coupled with
    the intention on the part of the landlord to exclude the tenant from
    possession, hence the requirement for a formal demand. As it is
    unlikely that the tenant will calmly submit, it is more common to
    instruct a solicitor to issue a writ of summons for possession.
2.  The landlord may institute legal proceedings for taking possession.
    The action should be brought before the District Court where the
    annual value of the property does not exceed \$250,000 or the rent
    payable by the tenant does not exceed \$250,000 a year or \$20,800 a
    month. Otherwise, the action should be brought in the High Court.
3.  However, the tenant may apply to court before judgment for relief
    from forfeiture by paying into court all the arrears of rent and
    costs, in which case the tenant would be able to continue with the
    lease and not have to enter into a newone.
4.  Even after judgment for possession, the tenant is still entitled to
    relief if he pays up the judgment sum with costs within 4 weeks of
    the judgment. The law is not explicit about whether relief is still
    available to the tenant where the landlord has entered into
    possession peaceably and changed the locks.

**Restrictions on forfeiture of lease**

**The law generally leans against forfeiture of the tenancy for
non-payment of rent.** The landlord is put to strict proof of his case
and the tenant is usually allowed a last chance to pay up the arrears.
It is only when he fails to pay that the tenancy can be forfeited.

Note that the landlord’s right to forfeit arises only if the payment of
rent is made a condition of the lease or if the right of forfeiture for
non-payment of rent is expressly reserved in the lease.

Technically, for the right of re-entry to arise, a formal demand by the
landlord must first be made unless the lease specifically provides
otherwise or unless the lease is a registered lease under the Land
Titles Act. In the case of premises under the Land Titles Act, the
landlord has an implied power to re-enter and thereby terminate the
tenancy if rent is in arrears for 30 days, even though no formal demand
is made.

Commonly Asked Questions on Enforcement Proceedings
---------------------------------------------------

### **QUESTIONS FROM THE LANDLORD**

**I terminated a rental agreement with the lodger/tenant for failure to
pay rent. Some of his belongings still remain at rental property. Can I
remove these items?**

The action of distress involves the landlord going into the demised
premises to impound goods up to the value of the rents owed, so as to
compel the tenant to pay up. The tenant is then given a stated period of
time to recover his goods by paying up all arrears. If the tenant fails
to repay within the time stipulated, the landlord can sell the goods and
reimburse himself for the rent owed, from the proceeds. Any balance must
be returned to the tenant.

**Can the Sheriff seize goods in a residential property when there is no
one at home?**

Yes, the Sheriff is empowered to break any door or window to enter a
property while enforcing his duties.[^37]

### **QUESTIONS FROM THE TENANT**

**My landlord is trying to evict me. What are my rights?**

You may apply to a judge to discharge or suspend the execution of the
writ, or to release any part of the property seized. The judge may, on
an application for the release of any property through one of the
following ways:[^38]

-   Deal with the matter summarily and dismiss the application or
    discharge the writ
-   Order the release unconditionally or on such terms as he thinks fit
    of any property seized
-   Direct an issue to be tried and, pending the determination of such
    issue, suspend the execution of the writ
-   Order the property to be sold and the proceeds of sale to be lodged
    in court
-   Make such other order on such terms as he considers fair as between
    the parties pending the final determination of the matter

**Can creditors seize my property located overseas?**

No. The Sheriff can only seize goods found on the premises.

**How do I get my belongings back from the landlord?**

If a landlord is in possession of the tenant’s goods and belongings due
to a seizure as a result of unpaid rent, the tenant may get back his
belongings by paying the overdue rent **within 5 days** (this is the
time frame stipulated in the writ of distress). If payment is not made,
the tenant’s belongings may be sold no earlier than 6 days after the
date of notice.

If a tenant wants to contest the seizure, an application to restrain the
execution of the writ may be made to a judge who will then make an order
as to how the property will be dealt with. If rent remains unpaid, the
property will likely be ordered to be sold to cover the outstanding
amount. Any balance proceeds will be returned to the tenant.

If a landlord is unlawfully in possession of a tenant’s belongings, a
tenant may commence a civil suit against the landlord for detinue for
unlawful detention of property, which may result in the return of their
property and/or compensation for their loss.

**May members of the public purchase goods that have been seized by the
Sheriff?**

Yes, items seized by the Sheriff will be auctioned at the place of
seizure during a Sheriff' s sale. The notice of sale is available on the
Supreme Court’s website as well as the place of seizure. However, if the
value of the goods exceeds S\$2,000.00, an advertisement will be
published in the Straits Times. All payments for goods purchased must be
in cash only.[^39]

**How can I find out whether there are any goods to be auctioned
off/sold by the Sheriff?**

Notices of sale will be posted on the Supreme Court’s website and in the
Straits Times.[^40]

**What happens if my mortgage isn't paid?**

If you cannot pay your mortgage after repeated warnings, your flat might
be repossessed by HDB. In this case, it is your responsibility to ensure
that your tenants vacate the premises.

As per the terms of the tenancy agreement between you and your tenant,
you might be liable for any compensation (e.g. by premature termination
of lease due to fault on your part) and or losses (e.g. for
transportation) incurred by your tenants.

**I am a tenant in a property. Can the Sheriff evict me from this
property?**

Yes, because the Sheriff is acting according to the orders of the Court.
However, tenants are given some time to move out from the property.[^41]

HDB Flats & Related Issues
--------------------------

### Owning A HDB Flat

**1. Regulations governing ownership**

A flat owner may transfer the flat ownership to other family members,
subject to the HDB eligibility schemes and eligibility criteria.

You are advised to contact the HDB directly in respect of the sale
and/or purchase of HDB flats. The HDB has devised their own form of
Agreement/Contract for the purchase of HDB flats.

An applicant can purchase the flat as a sole owner of the flat. If there
are two or more owners, they can own the HDB flat either as
joint-tenants or tenants-in-common. A maximum of four owners are allowed
for each flat.

**2. Changing the manner of holding or the proportion of shares held**

After the purchase of the flat, flat owners are allowed to change the
holding type from joint-tenancy to tenancy-in-common, and vice versa.
Existing flat owners who are holding the flat under tenancy-in-common
can also apply to change the shares of flat ownership they are holding.
The total shares of flat ownership must be in fractions and must add up
to one whole.

**3. Inclusion and deletion of occupiers**[^42]

After the purchase of the flat, flat owners can apply to include their
family members or immediate relatives as occupiers of the flat. The
proposed occupiers must meet HDB’s eligibility conditions, set out in
the following tables:

*Eligibility criteria for subsidised flats, which include flats bought
from HDB, resale flats bought with the CPF Housing Grant, and Design,
Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats purchased directly from developers)*

+-----+----------------------------------+----------------------------+

Flat owners may delete the names of the existing occupiers, as long as
the deletion does not make the flat owners ineligible to retain the
flat.

You are advised to contact HDB if you require more information.

### Retention & Transfer Of Flat Ownership

Existing flat owners may transfer the ownership of their flat to other
family members or apply to retain the flat due to changes to the family
structure, e.g. marriage, divorce or death of co-owner(s) or
occupier(s), subject to HDB’s eligibility rules and conditions to own a
flat.

Commonly Asked Questions on Retention & Transfer of Ownership of HDB Flat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP**

**Can I relinquish ownership of my HDB flat?**

Yes, but only to family members subject to the HDB eligibility schemes
and eligibility criteria. The change of ownership is without monetary
consideration and is by way of gift on grounds of love and affection.

Please note that a maximum of 4 owners are allowed for each flat. If
there are 2 or more flat owners, they can choose to own the HDB flat
under joint-tenancy or tenancy-in-common.

**Can I list a minor as an owner of a jointly-owned flat?**

No, a joint owner should be at least 21.

**Can I be made an occupier of the HDB flat jointly owned by my
parents?**

Yes, after your parents have purchased a flat, they can submit an
application to HDB to include you as occupier of the flat. However, you
must meet HDB’s prevailing eligibility conditions.

**I am currently renting a flat from HDB. Can I transfer the tenancy of
the existing flat to a non-occupier of the flat?**

No. The proposed registered tenant must be an existing authorised
occupier and he must be able to retain the flat under either the Family
Scheme or Joint Singles Scheme.

**I wish to transfer an existing tenancy to an eligible tenant. Will the
proposed registered tenant be granted a fresh 2-year term tenancy?**

No. The proposed registered tenant will only be granted the balance of
the 2-year term tenancy.

**My father has passed away. My mother is the only occupier of the
rented flat. Can she take over the tenancy of the flat?**

Yes, your mother is allowed to take over the tenancy.

**I am staying in a 2-room rental flat. My flatmate has passed away. Can
I retain the flat?**

No.

You need to include another eligible single person and transfer to a
1-room flat under the Joint Singles Scheme.

**My flat that I solely own is mortgaged to a bank/financial
institution. Am I allowed to transfer ownership of my flat?**

You need to check with your bank/financial institution whether they have
any objections to the change in ownership of the flat. Please note that
if the purchase of the flat has been financed with a mortgage loan from
a bank or the HDB, then the flat may be sold by the bank through a
mortgagee sale, or compulsorily acquired by the HDB in the event the
owners default in the mortgage repayment and run up mortgage arrears.

**How can I remove my name from being the co-owner of a HDB flat?**

If you contributed towards the payment of the flat from your individual
CPF account, the other co-owners of the HDB flat must agree to top up
this amount, including interest. Resale part-share is also available
between family members (but not between for married couples). This
involves a change in flat ownership by way of a partial sale/purchase
between flat members at a mutually agreed price.

Purchasing & Investing in Private Properties
--------------------------------------------

HDB flat owners and occupiers of the following sold flats are allowed to
purchase private residential property (both local and overseas) if the
flat owners have fulfilled the minimum occupation period (“MOP”) for
their flat.

There is no limit on the number of private properties that a flat owner
or occupier can purchase, and the private residential properties can
still be under construction or ready for possession. However, flat
owners must meet certain eligibility conditions:[^43]

  from HDB                flats before acquiring private residential
                          property. Periods of non-occupation such as
                          subletting of whole flat or any infringement of
                          the lease of the flat will be excluded from the
                          MOP.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Singapore Permanent Resident flat owners and/or essential family members
who have met the MOP for their flat are required to notify HDB of their
purchase of the local private residential property before they exercise
the Option-To-Purchase for the property. They are also required to
undertake to sell their HDB flat within 6 months of acquisition of a
completed or uncompleted local private residential property.

Singapore Citizen flat owners and occupiers must continue to stay in
their HDB flat after the purchase of the private residential property
unless prior approval from HDB is obtained to sublet the whole flat.

### Common Asked Questions On Purchasing & Investing In Private Properties

**I have bought a private residential property. Can I sublet my HDB flat
and live in my private property?**

Flat owners must obtain prior approval from HDB to sublet their flats
under the Subletting of Flat policy. Please refer to the rest of this
chapter for the relevant conditions and minimum occupation period for
your flat.

**I have not fulfilled the minimum occupation period (“MOP”). I want to
buy a private residential property that is under construction. By the
time the property gets its temporary occupation permit, I would have
fulfilled the minimum occupation period. Can I?**

No.

You cannot invest in private residential property anytime during the
MOP. This is regardless of whether the private property is completed or
under construction.

**I have not fulfilled the minimum occupation period (“MOP”). What are
the types of private properties I can invest in?**

If you have not fulfilled the MOP, you can only invest in:

-   Pure commercial properties
-   Pure industry properties
-   Vacant land not zoned for residential development

You cannot invest in any type of property that is classified as
residential or has residential accommodation.

**Example:** Mr. Tan has not fulfilled the minimum occupation period for
his HDB flat. He wants to invest in a two-storey shop house. The first
storey is a retail shop. The second storey is an apartment. He cannot
invest because the property offers residential accommodation.

**What happens if I buy or invest in private residential property
without fulfilling the minimum occupation period?**

HDB may repossess/reacquire your HDB flat. HDB may allow you to keep
your flat if you sell off your private residential property and pay the
penalty imposed by HDB. For more information, please approach the HDB
Branch Office managing your flat.

**Is it possible to claim just compensation from HDB for
repossession/reacquisition of my HDB flat?**

No. Just compensation is compensation provided to owners whose private
real property has been seized by the Singapore government’s power of
eminent domain under the Land Acquisition Act, which allows it to take
property for public use (e.g. Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme).
It does not apply for repossession/re-acquisition due to tenant’s
failure to fulfill HDB’s requirements under the minimum occupation
period. The flat owner is returned only the amount he paid for the flat,
with a further penalty imposed on this. For more information, please
approach the HDB Branch Office managing your flat.

Bankruptcy and Sale of Property
-------------------------------

Sale of flat by an undischarged bankrupt

A letter of consent from the Official Assignee (OA) is required for the
sale of flat (for all flat types) by an undischarged bankrupt. The
seller must obtain the letter of consent before granting an Option to
Purchase to the buyers.

The OA administers the bankrupt’s affairs in the bankruptcy, Therefore,
if a bankrupt person has fulfilled the minimum occupation period for his
current flat and wants to sell the flat, he must seek the OA’s approval
before selling the flat.

Sale of flat to an undischarged bankrupt

If you are selling an Executive flat (apartment/maisonette), a Housing
and Urban Development Company (HUDC) flat or a Multi-Generations flat,
and your intended buyer is an undischarged bankrupt, make sure that your
buyer has obtained a letter of consent from the OA for the purchase.

You are advised to refer to the Insolvency & Public Trustee’s Office’s
website[^44] for more information.

### Commonly Asked Questions On Bankruptcy And Sale Of Property

**My wife and I are co-owners of a HDB flat and we intend to sell our
flat in the open market. If I am an undischarged bankrupt but my wife is
not, do we still need to obtain a Letter of Consent from the Official
Assignee (“OA”)?**

Yes. As long as one of the flat owners is an undischarged bankrupt, it
is necessary to obtain a Letter of Consent from the OA for the sale of
the flat (for all flat types). The seller must obtain the Letter of
Consent before granting an Option to Purchase to the buyers.

**I am bankrupt. Can I transfer the ownership of my flat to my family
members?**

Yes. However, before submitting your transfer application to HDB, you
will need to obtain consent from the OA. Current and proposed owners who
are undischarged bankrupts must always obtain the consent of the OA
before submitting a transfer application to HDB. Please note that the
transfer of flat ownership is subject to the proposed owners’
eligibility to take over the flat.

The OA’s consent is not required if a bankrupt flat owner wishes to sell
his or her HDB flat which does not vest in the OA. This applies to
bankrupt flat owners who belong to Singapore Citizen households.

Bankrupt flat owners of Singapore Permanent Resident Households must get
the OA’s consent before they can sell their flat. The letter of consent
must be obtained from the OA before the owners grant an Option to
Purchase to the prospective buyers.[^45]

Appealing a HDB Decision

There is no process for appeal of an HDB decision.

You may write directly to the HDB to appeal your matter. You may also
approach your Member of Parliament (“MP”) to appeal to the HDB on your
behalf. To date, the law is not settled on whether you may apply for
judicial review of a HDB decision, where the court will determine the
legality of HDB’s decision.

Maintenance, Repairs, Leakages & Disputes in Strata Management Title
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Maintenance Of Exterior Features

Section 9(1) of the **Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act**
(Cap. 30C) makes it an offense for a person to fail to maintain a
exterior feature by securely fixing it to the building to prevent its
collapse, partly or wholly, without reasonable excuse, if he is
responsible for the exterior feature.

The person responsible for maintenance of exterior features of the
building is generally the **owner of the premises or building** which
the exterior feature is on, or such other person who has charge and
control of the management and maintenance of the exterior feature,
unless:[^46]

-   The exterior feature is part of any common property of any HDB
    housing estate, in which case the responsible person is the Town
    Council established under the Town Councils Act (Cap. 329A) for that
    housing estate or the contractor (if any) engaged by the Town
    Council and who has charge and control of the management and
    maintenance of the common property.
-   The exterior feature is part of any common property or limited
    common property of any other land (whether or not comprised in a
    strata title plan), in which case the responsible person is the
    owner thereof or the managing agent (if any) appointed by the owner
    and who has charge and control of the management and maintenance of
    the common property or limited common property.
-   The exterior feature is a window, grille or shutter that is part of
    a flat, the responsible person is the owner of that flat or other
    person who ordinarily has daily charge and control over the
    maintenance and use of such window, grille or shutter
-   Someone else has been prescribed as the person responsible for the
    exterior feature (such a provision shall be determinative even if
    one of the above conditions applies).

### HDB Flats

**(a) Ceiling leaks**

When ceiling leaks occur, you should contact the HDB. HDB will send
someone to investigate the cause of the leak. To establish the cause,
HDB will need to enter your flat and the flat above yours.

> According to your Lease Agreement with HDB, you and the owner of the
> flat above are responsible for repairing the leak if the leak is

You can contact HDB for a list of qualified contractors.

**(b) Spalling concrete**

Under the Lease Agreement, HDB flat owners are responsible for the
maintenance of their flats’ internal condition. This includes the
repairs of spalling concrete.

Commonly Asked Questions on Maintenance & Leakages
--------------------------------------------------

**Who is responsible for inter-floor leaks?**

If there is an inter-floor leak, you and your neighbour are required to
**jointly** carry out an investigation to establish the cause of the
leak and proceed with the repair works. You should also both resolve the
cost of repair.

In cases like this, it is presumed that the leak has originated from the
upper floor unit unless the owner can prove otherwise. Therefore, the
owner of the upper floor unit cannot claim that the leak has not
originated from a defect in his unit. He has to jointly investigate the
cause with his lower-floor neighbour and proceed with any repairs
required.[^47]

**What maintenance is the developer/management corporation of my
condominium responsible for?**

According to Section 16 of the Building Maintenance and Strata
Management Act (Cap. 30C), the developer must establish a maintenance
fund to be used for day-to-day management and maintenance purposes, such
as:

-   Paying for cleaning and security services[^48]
-   Maintaining, repairing and renewing certain fixtures and fittings
    (including lifts)[^49]
-   Maintaining, repairing and renewing sewers, pipes, wires, cables and
    ducts that can be used between 2 or more units or the common
    property of the development[^50]

Purchasers contribute to the maintenance fund by monthly charges.

The developer/management corporation must also establish a “sinking
fund” to provide for future capital needs, such as large-scale
maintenance and improvements (e.g. painting of the common property,
acquiring movable property, and renewing or replacing any fixtures on
the common property).[^51]

**The air conditioning in my newly-rented HDB flat is broken and the
landlord refuses to fix it; can I make a claim against my landlord or
agent? Alternatively, can I back out of the agreement?**

You should consult the Tenancy Agreement that you signed prior to
renting the flat. It should clearly outline your landlord’s
responsibilities.

The common practice in most Agreements is that the tenant must inform
the landlord of any repairs to be done or any damage/equipment
malfunction within the first 14 days of moving in, after which, any
minor repairs (up to a certain cost) will fall to the tenant. If these
14 days (or the stipulated grace period in your agreement) is not up,
you may request your landlord to cover the cost of repairing the air
conditioner.

Tenants are usually responsible for the periodic servicing of
air-conditioners thereafter and for the costs of repairs (up to a
certain cost).

**Can I reduce my rent payment due to failure of the landlord to service
the air conditioning?**

No.

You cannot reduce your rent to offset the landlord’s failure of failing
to meet the terms of the agreement. You can only take up a separate
claim against him. Even so, most Tenancy Agreements state that the cost
of periodically servicing air conditioning facilities should be borne by
the tenant. Furthermore, any minor repairs (up to a certain cost) will
fall to the tenant. You might thus not have a claim against the landlord
at all. Please check your Tenancy Agreement.

**What if I am not happy with a landlord’s repairs?**

Prior to a tenant moving in, the landlord is required to provide a
residential premises that is clean and in a good state of repair. A
landlord must also maintain the property, carrying out repairs as
necessary during the tenancy. If before moving in the repairs are not up
to standard, you can either refuse to move in due to the landlord’s
breach of contract and take action to recover your deposit at the Small
Claims Tribunal or move in and complete the repairs yourself, then take
legal action against the landlord for compensation by lodging a claim
with the Small Claims Tribunal.

**My tenant has breached the repair covenants for a commercial property.
What can I do?**

You should check the terms of your Tenancy Agreement to see if you are
entitled to any compensation. Alternatively, provisions may be available
to enable you to bring the lease to an end prematurely. You will need to
first serve notice on the tenant specifying the breaches of the covenant
to allow him an opportunity to remedy the breach first.

**The landlord is claiming payment for "wear and tear" - am I liable to
pay this amount?**

Yes.

Lessees/tenants of upper and lower floor units share the responsibility
of maintaining the party structures, including the floor/ceiling slabs.
If the cause of the ceiling leakage is due to the wear and tear of the
waterproof membrane/screed in the floor slab through usage over time,
the upper and lower floor tenants sharing the use of the slab, are
responsible to jointly arrange for the repair works and share the repair
cost.

Referral of Disputes to the Strata Titles Boards
------------------------------------------------

Unless otherwise provided by Building Maintenance and Strata Management
Act (Cap. 30C) (the Act) or the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap. 158), the
Strata Titles Boards ("STB") shall determine by mediation-arbitration
every matter with respect to which it has jurisdiction.

**(a) Strata Titles Boards**

> The STB is a statutory body that is made up of a panel of members who
> are lawyers and experienced practitioners in the building industry. A
> board is constituted to hear each dispute. The decisions of the STB
> are final. After such a decision, an appeal can only be made to the
> High Court on a question of law.
>
> **(b) Types of disputes or orders requested**
>
> Not all disputes can be referred to the STB. Only disputes listed in
> the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act can be heard by the
> STB, including settling dispute on costs or repairs, or rectifying a
> complaint in respect of a defect in a lot, a subdivided building and
> the common property.
>
> For matters that are outside the jurisdiction of the STB, the
> disputing parties can seek resolution from the courts.
>
> You should consult the STB website[^52] and the Act for the different
> types of orders you may apply for, and the parties who are entitled to
> apply for each type of order.

**(c) Application procedure**[^53]

> You may make the application yourself and represent yourself, or you
> may engage a lawyer or ask someone (whom the Board must allow) to
> represent you. If you do not intend to engage a lawyer, you may
> nonetheless want to at least obtain legal advice first and consult the
> STB website[^54] so that you proceed under the correct section and use

En-Bloc Sale
------------

A collective sale (or more commonly termed en-bloc sale) is a combined
sale by the owners of 2 or more property units to a common
purchaser.[^56]

The most common en-bloc sale is the sale of all the units in a strata or
flatted development to a purchaser. The sale proceeds are then divided
amongst all the unit owners.[^57] Other variations of en-bloc sales
include the sale of all units in a development together with an
adjoining development or landed properties.[^58]

### Considerations In An En-Bloc Sale

**1. Consent of a specified majority**[^59]

An en-bloc sale of all the units in a strata or flatted development can
take place only if there is agreement by both:

-   A specified majority (based on share value, share in land or
    notional share) of the unit owners.
-   A specified majority of the total area of all the lots in a strata
    or flatted development.

**Specified majority**[^60]

**If a development is less than 10 years old:** (Calculated from the
date of the issue of the latest Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”), or
the Certificate of Statutory Completion (“CSC”) if there is no TOP) The
owners of at least **90%** of the share values, share in land, or
notional share in the land and not less than 90% of the total area of
all lots (excluding the area of any accessory lot) or flats must agree.

**If a development is 10 years old or more:** The owners of at least
**80%** of the share values, share in land, or notional share in the
land and not less than 80% of the total area of all lots (excluding the
area of any accessory lot) or flats must agree.

Agreement must be made in writing to sell all the units and common
property or land to a purchaser under a sale and purchase agreement
(subject to an order of the STB).

You are advised to consult Part VA of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap.
158) for further details.

**2. Types of developments**[^61]

The developments for which an application can be made for an order for
en-bloc sale by majority agreement are:

-   Strata developments registered under the Land Titles (Strata)
    Act[^62].
-   Strata or flat developments where the owners of the flats also own a
    share in the land and the leases for their flats are registered
    under the Registration of Deeds Act or the Land Titles Act[^63].
-   Strata or flat developments where the owners of the flats own a
    registered leasehold tenure of 850 years or more (or such other
    leasehold period as the Minister may specify) but they do not own
    the land in the development. The leases for the flats may be
    registered under the Registration of Deeds Act or the Land Titles
    Act[^64]\*.
-   Strata developments where the owners of the flats own a registered
    leasehold tenure of 850 years or more (or such other leasehold
    period as the Minister may specify). The subsisting leases for the
    strata lots are registered under the Land Titles (Strata) Act[^65].

\* As there are no share values or shares in land assigned to flats in
such developments, the owners of at least 25% of the total number of
flats in the development must apply to the Registrar of Titles for
notional shares in land to be assigned to their individual flats to
facilitate calculation of the majority agreement.[^66]

**3. Application procedure**[^67]

**Step 1: Pre-application**

The duly-constituted collective sale committee must:

1.  Hold and conduct General Meetings pursuant to the Second Schedule of
    the Land Titles Act in relation to the en-bloc sale

-   The Second Schedule sets out the provisions that govern the conduct
    and proceedings of the General Meetings of the Management
    Corporations for the purposes of an en-bloc sale.
-   The Third Schedule sets out the provisions that govern the
    composition, constitution and proceedings of a collective sales
    committee

1.  Appoint up to 3 owners from the collective sale committee to
    represent them in connection with the application[^68].
2.  Obtain a valuation report for the whole development from an
    independent valuer as at the date of the close of the public tender
    or auction[^69].
3.  Obtain a report by an independent valuer on the proposed method of
    distributing the sale proceeds[^70].
4.  Advertise the particulars of the proposed application in the local
    newspapers, as approved by the Board, in the 4 official
    languages.[^71] The advertisement must include:[^72]

-   Information on the development, i.e. name, land, lot number and
    address
-   Brief details of the sale proposal
-   The place at which the relevant parties can inspect the documents
    for the en-bloc sale.

1.  Prepare the application to be made to the Board. A copy of the
    application form may be downloaded from the STB website[^73] or
    obtained from the URA Centre
2.  Serve a notice of the proposed application by registered post to all
    unit owners and to the mortgagee, chargee or other person (other
    than a lessee) with an estate or interest in the unit and whose
    interest is notified on the land register.[^74] The notice must
    include a copy of:[^75]

-   The advertisement referred to above
-   Collective sale agreement
-   The sale and purchase agreement
-   A statutory declaration made by the purchaser on his relationship,
    if any, to the unit owners
-   The valuation report referred to above
-   The report by an independent valuer on the proposed method of
    distributing the sale proceeds, referred to above

1.  Affix a copy of the notice, in the 4 official languages, to a
    conspicuous part of each building in the development[^76].
2.  The notice to be served by registered post shall be served on a
    party:[^77]

-   Where the party is an owner of a unit registered under the Land
    Titles (Strata) Act, at the address as shown on the strata roll.
-   Where the party is an owner of a unit not registered under the Land
    Titles (Strata) Act, at the last recorded address at the Singapore
    Land Authority (“SLA”).
-   Where the party is a mortgagee, chargee or other person with an
    estate and interest in the unit whose interest is notified on the
    land register, at the address on the strata roll or last recorded
    address at the SLA.
-   Where the party is a management corporation, at its address as shown
    in the SLA.

    > **Step 2: Application**
    >
    > The application for en-bloc sale must be made using the approved
    > form within 14 days of the publication of the advertisement. The
    > application is to be made by way of a statutory declaration by the
    > representatives appointed by the majority owners, stating that the
    > relevant provisions of the Act have been complied with.
    >
    > The application must include the following:[^78]

-   The documents set out in para 7 of the *Pre-Application* section
    above.
-   A list of the names of the unit owners who have not agreed to the
    sale in writing, their mortgagees, chargees, the subsidiary
    proprietors in reversion of the leasehold estate in the lots and
    other persons (other than lessees) with an estate or interest in the
    flats whose interests are reflected in the land registers.
-   Such other documents that the Board may require.
-   An undertaking to pay the costs of the Board in relation to any
    valuation or other reports called for by the Board.

    > 6 copies of all documents mentioned above are to be submitted to
    > the office.
    >
    > **Step 3: Post-application**
    >
    > After submitting the application at the applicants must lodge a
    > copy, in the approved form, for registration at the SLA. A copy of
    > the forms can be downloaded from the SLA website[^79].

**4. Objections**[^80]

A unit owner who has not agreed to the sale in writing, his mortgagee,
chargee or other person with an estate or interest in the unit may,
within 21 days of the date of the notice for en-bloc sale, file an
objection in the prescribed form (1 original & 5 photocopies) with the
STB.[^81]

The Board will, within 5 days of the filing of an objection, forward a
copy of it by registered post to the representatives appointed by the
majority owners and their lawyers, if any.[^82]

**5. Board approval**[^83]

The factors that the Board will take into account in its decision will
depend on whether an objection has been filed against the application.

**Where no objection has been filed against the application**

The Board will approve the application unless, after going through the
application, it is satisfied that the transaction is not entered into in
good faith, after taking into account:

-   The sale price for the whole development
-   The method of distributing the sale proceeds
-   The relationship of the purchaser to any of the flat owners

The Board will not approve an application if:[^84]

-   The sale agreement requires any unit owner who has not agreed in
    writing to the sale to be a party to any arrangement for the
    redevelopment of the property; or
-   If the collective sale committee does not consent to any order made
    by the Board in relation to an increase in the sale proceeds to be
    received by the owners objecting to the sale (where it is just and
    equitable to do so in the opinion of the Board).

**Where objections have been filed against the application**[^85]

The Board will consider the objection and the same factors stated above,
and may call for mediation.

The Board will not approve an application if it is satisfied that:

-   The unit owner who objects to the sale will suffer a financial
    loss\*; or
-   The sale proceeds to be received by a unit owner, his mortgagee or
    chargee, are insufficient to redeem any mortgage or charge against
    the flat.

\* A unit owner will be considered to suffer financial loss if the sale
proceeds for his unit, after any deduction (such as stamp duty and legal
fees paid on purchase of the unit, privatization costs and costs
incurred in the collective sale) allowed by the Board, are less than
what he paid for the unit.

\* A unit owner will not be considered to suffer financial loss simply
because:

-   His net gain from the sale will be less than the other unit owners
-   The proceeds of sale for his unit, after such deductions as the
    Board may allow, is less than the price he paid for his unit if he
    had purchased his unit after the collective sale committee had
    already signed an agreement to sell all the units and common
    property in the development to a purchaser[^86]

**6. Effects of an order by the Board**[^87]

**Owners of units and land**[^88]

An order for en-bloc sale issued by the Board is binding on all the unit
and land owners of the development (including their successors in title
and assigns), their mortgagees, chargees and persons with an estate or
interest in the units and land (including lessees).

Under such an order, all the unit owners must sell their units (together
with the land) to the purchaser in accordance with the sale and purchase
agreement. They must produce the certificates of title and relevant
title deeds to the representatives appointed by the majority owners for
the purpose of the sale.

**Owners of land in an application under section 84E where the unit
owners of a 850-year registered leasehold estate do not own a share in
the land**[^89]

Where the Board makes an order for the en-bloc sale of the units and the
land, the owner of the land (or reversion) will be deemed to have
transferred his estate and interest to the land to the purchaser upon
the registration by the Registrar of titles of the transfers of all the
units in the development and the Registrar of titles shall enter a
notification of the vesting of the land in the purchaser on the land
register.

**Owners of a registered leasehold in an application under section 84FA
where the unit owners own the registered leasehold tenure of at least
850 years or other tenure**

Where the Board makes an order for the en-bloc sale of the units and the
common property in the strata title plan, the unit owner in reversion of
the leasehold estate will be deemed to have transferred his estate and
interest in the unit to the purchaser upon the registration by the
Registrar of Titles of the transfers of all the units in the strata
title plan and the Registrar of Titles shall enter a notification of the
vesting of the reversionary interest in the purchaser on the subsidiary
strata land register.[^90]

**Effect on leases of the units**[^91]

A lease against any of the units (other than the lease held by the unit
owner) shall, unless there is an earlier agreed date, determine on the
date on which vacant possession is required to be given to the
purchaser. The order does not prejudice the lessee's right to any
compensation from the unit owner. Unit owners or their lessees can apply
to the Board to determine the amount of compensation payable.

| Commonly Asked Questions on En-Bloc Sale

**Can the majority owners apply to the board to appoint a third party to
act for certain unit owners in the sale?**

The representatives appointed by the majority owners may apply to the
Board to appoint a person to deal with all matters pertaining to the
sale of a flat where:[^92]

-   The unit owner has died and no personal representative has been
    appointed; or
-   In any other case as the Board may think fit.

**Who can appear in a hearing before the board?**

Where a Board has appointed a date for hearing, it will, where
necessary, give a notice of the hearing to all parties to the dispute or
matter.[^93]

A party entitled to appear before the Board may appear in person or may
be represented by his lawyer or such other person as the Board may
allow. The representative may examine witnesses and address the Board on
behalf of the party.[^94]

Divorce & Separation: Property Considerations
---------------------------------------------

### Divorce

**If the couple has children:** Under the HDB’s prevailing policy for
divorce (not due to non-consummation of marriage or annulment or
break-up of fiancé/fiancée relationship), a divorced party who has the
custody of the child (including care and control) is allowed to retain
the flat subject to the eligibility conditions.[^95]

**If the couple has no children:** If there are no children from the
marriage, the divorced party (flat owner) may retain the flat under the
Single Singapore Citizen (“SSC”) Scheme, provided that:[^96]

-   He/she is a Singapore citizen.
-   He/she is at least 35 years old.
-   The matrimonial flat is a resale flat purchased from the open market
    without the CPF Housing Grant for Family.

**MOP required:** If the matrimonial flat was bought directly from HDB
(including resale flats bought with the CPF Housing Grant for Family),
the 5-year minimum occupation period (“MOP”) must be satisfied before
the divorced party is allowed to take over the flat under the SSC
Scheme.

Alternatively, the divorced party may include another person to retain
the flat, subject to the prevailing eligibility criteria and eligibility
scheme regardless of the occupation period.[^97]

\*\*Resale of flat in the open <market:**> If the divorced owners wish
to resell their flat in the open market, they must have completed the
MOP for the flat at the date of divorce completion. If the divorce is
within the MOP and none of the owners is eligible to retain the flat,
the owners may have to return the flat to HDB, subject to HDB’s
approval. The compensation for the return of flat will be determined by
HDB.[^98]

### Separation

A separated party who has legal custody of the child (including care and
control) pursuant to a Court Order is allowed to retain the flat,
subject to the eligibility conditions. If there are no children from the
marriage, one party may include another person to retain the flat,
subject to the prevailing eligibility criteria and eligibility scheme
regardless of the occupation period.[^99]

If neither party from the separated couple is able to retain the flat,
they will need to dispose of the flat. If they have completed the
minimum occupation period (“MOP”), they can resell the flat in the open
market. If they have not completed the MOP, they will have to return the
flat to HDB at the prevailing compensation price, subject to HDB’s
approval.[^100]

Commonly Asked Questions on Property Considerations in Divorce & Separation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Can I prevent my spouse from selling our matrimonial home?**

If divorce proceedings have commenced and one spouse attempts to sell or
dispose of property which rightly falls to be classified as matrimonial
property with a view towards dissipating the assets so as to prevent the
other from claiming a share, it is possible that the spouse with the
potential claim can:

-   Lodge a caveat with the Land Titles Registry claiming a beneficial
    interest in the property which may prevent the other from selling or
    dealing with the property without notice; **and**
-   Apply to court for injunctive relief to stop the intended sale of
    the property

**What factors affect the division of property in the event of
divorce?**

There are several factors that a Court will take into account for the
division of matrimonial assets in the event of a divorce, including:

-   Direct and indirect contributions made by the parties
-   Financial capacity of the parties
-   Needs of minor children (if any) of the marriage

**In the event of divorce, can I claim back 50% of the HDB sale
proceeds?**

The balance from the proceeds of sale is divided in the proportion
decided by the court or as agreed between both parties. Prior to that,
sale proceeds will first be used to pay off any outstanding mortgage
loans for the flat and returning the amount both parties have
contributed from their individual CPF accounts.

There are several factors that a Court will take into account for the
division of matrimonial assets in the event of a divorce including:

-   Direct and indirect contributions made by the parties
-   Financial capacity of the parties
-   Needs of minor children (if any) of the marriage

**How can I prove that I contributed to the purchase of my property?**

You should check with your bank in order to provide the documentary
proof that you paid for the purchase of the house or the installments
paid in order to repay the loan (if any).

**Can I sell our jointly-owned HDB flat after filing for a divorce?**

No, the procedure of the division of the assets must be concluded, and
if the matrimonial flat is bought directly from HDB (including resale
flats bought with the CPF Housing Grant for Family), “the 5-year minimum
occupation period (“MOP”) must be satisfied before the divorced party is
allowed to take over the flat under the Single Singapore Citizen (“SSC”)
Scheme.[^101]

Alternatively, the divorced party may include another person to retain
the flat, subject to the prevailing eligibility criteria and eligibility
scheme regardless of the occupation period.[^102]

If the divorced owners wish to resell their flat in the open market,
they must have completed the MOP for the flat, as at the date of divorce
completion. If the divorce is within the MOP and none of the owners is
eligible to retain the flat, the owners may have to return the flat to
HDB, subject to HDB’s approval. The compensation for the return of flat
will be determined by HDB.[^103]

**Can I get a proportion of the sale proceeds if the flat is sold prior
to one of us filing for divorce?**

**If flat is under both names:** you have a proprietary interest in the
matrimonial property. If the flat is under your spouse’s name, you have
a beneficial interest if the property is a matrimonial property.

If the flat has not yet been sold, you should lodge a caveat with the
Land Title’s Registry to protect your interest. This puts any potential
buyers on notice of your interest when they conduct a Land Titles
Search. Additionally, either spouse may apply to the court under section
59 of the Women’s Charter to make an order stating each party’s
proportional interest in the property.

**If flat is under name of one spouse only:** If the flat is under only
one spouse’s name and you have not lodged a caveat to protect your
interest in the matrimonial property, the danger is that if the property
is sold before divorce proceedings are commenced, your spouse can
squander away the proceeds. Once the sale has occurred, it will be much
more difficult for you to obtain a portion of the proceeds. However,
there are remedies such as tracing of assets, as well as asking a court
to grant an injunction over the spousal assets, which prevents the
spouse from dealing with the proceeds of sale in a manner affecting the
other spouse’s entitlement to such proceeds.

Conversely, if a flat under only one spouse’s name has been sold, but
the money has merely been put aside in that spouse’s bank account, once
divorce proceedings are commenced, the proceeds of sale become pooled
together with all other matrimonial assets that the court distributes
between the parties when dealing with ancillary matters in the divorce
proceedings. The court prefers to take a “global approach” by taking the
total value of the pooled assets and making a distribution amongst the
parties in a proportion it deems appropriate once all the financial and
non-financial contributions by both parties have been assessed.
Nevertheless, it is always best to protect your interests and prevent a
situation that allows your spouse to siphon the proceeds fraudulently.
It is advised that you request for the court to grant an injunction over
the spousal assets.

**Can I purchase my spouse’s share of property?**

If parties can agree on one spouse purchasing the other spouse’s share
of the property, an Agreed Matrimonial Property Plan is filed.[^104] If
parties cannot agree, yet one party wants to purchase the other spouse’s
share of the property, both parties can file individual Proposed
Matrimonial Property Plans.[^105] These proposals will assist the Court
in deciding how to divide the property. The Court may accept or reject
the whole or any part of the Agreed or Proposed Matrimonial Property
Plan(s). The Court may also impose such terms and conditions as it
thinks fit when dividing the matrimonial assets as well as give such
directions as may be necessary to give effect to the orders made. In
making its decision, the Court will also consider a number of other
factors including: the financial and non-financial contributions of the
parties towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the HDB flat, the
contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, the needs
of the children of the marriage, whether the husband or the wife has
custody, care and control of the children.

In the end, the Court has to be satisfied that the agreement reflects an
effective and fair resolution between the parties for the disposition of
matrimonial property.

**How can I ensure my children get my share of the HDB flat in the event
of death or divorce of my spouse?**

**Death**

Spouses typically hold the matrimonial property as joint-tenants.

The effect of this is that co-owners have an equal interest in the flat
regardless of the individual owner’s contribution to buy the flat. A
joint tenancy also contains a right of survivorship, which means that
upon the death of a joint-tenant, his/her interest in the flat will
automatically be passed to the remaining co-owner(s), regardless of
whether the deceased joint-tenant has left behind a will. The result is
that in the event of your death, your share in the property cannot be
transferred to your children even if you have named them as
beneficiaries in your will.

To ensure that your children will get your share of the HDB flat when
you pass away, you can sever the joint-tenancy. Severance converts the
form of co-ownership into a tenancy-in-common. Tenancy-in-common is a
form of ownership where each co-owner holds a separate and definite
share in the flat. However, all the co-owners are entitled to live in
the whole flat regardless of their share in the property. The
distinguishing feature is that there is no right of survivorship in a
tenancy-in-common. The deceased's interest in the flat does not pass on
automatically to the remaining co-owner(s).

Upon the death of a tenant-in-common, the deceased's interest in the
flat will be distributed according to his will (if any) or according to
the provisions of the Intestate Succession Act. Hence, if your children
are named as beneficiaries in your will, they can inherit your share of
the property.

You are advised to refer to Chapter 17.1 of this manual for more details
on the severance of a joint-tenancy.

**Divorce**

Courts generally protect the child’s interest by allowing him/her to
live in the same house or place of residence, therefore the divorced
party who has the custody of the child (including care and control) is
allowed to retain the flat subject to HDB’s eligibility conditions.

**Am I eligible to purchase a HDB flat while separated?**

No.

HDB has clear criteria determining who can purchase a HDB flat and under
what Scheme. Additionally, you can only own one HDB flat at one time.
One of the parties may retain the existing matrimonial HDB flat, but
certain conditions must be met.

Under HDB's prevailing policy, a separated party who has the custody of
their child is allowed to retain the flat subject to the eligibility
conditions. If there are no children from the marriage, one party may
include another person to retain the flat, subject to the prevailing
eligibility criteria and eligibility scheme regardless of the occupation
period.

If neither party from the separated couple is able to retain the flat,
disposal of the flat is required. If they have completed the minimum
occupation period (“MOP”), they can resell the flat in the open market.
If they have not completed the MOP, they would have to return the flat
to HDB at the prevailing compensation price, subject to HDB's approval.
