+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Commercial       | | Deals with specialised offences relating to   |

|                    | | outraging of modesty and rape cases.          |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Criminal         | | An accused person is summoned to a Criminal   |
| Mentions Courts**  |   Mentions Court when the prosecution           |
|                    | | is ready to formally charge him/her, no       |
|                    |   longer than 48 hours after his/her            |
|                    | | arrest and remand.                            |
|                    | | There are two criminal mentions courts:       |
|                    |   District Arrest Cases (DACs) and the          |
|                    | | other with Magistrates’ Arrest Cases          |
|                    |   (MACs).[^3] The charge is then read and       |
|                    | | explained to the accused. If they plead       |
|                    |   guilty, they are then transferred to          |
|                    | | either sentencing courts or District Court    |
|                    |   (DC) No.1.                                    |
|                    | | DC No.1 allows a presiding judge to grant     |
|                    |   appropriate applications of the               |

|                    | | to detain an accused for further              |
|                    |   investigations and applications to engage     |
|                    | | defence counsel. If an accused claims trial,  |
|                    |   the presiding judge will then fix             |
|                    | | the case for a pre-trail conference before a  |
|                    |   Group Manager Judge under the                 |

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Filter Court**   | | Generally deals with Night Court cases where  |
|                    |   the accused have claimed trial,               |
|                    | | and other simple cases which require up to a  |
|                    |   day’s trial. It is also a holding             |
|                    | | court which filters cases to other trial      |
|                    |   courts.[^5]                                   |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Traffic Court**  | | The traffic Court hears and tries traffic     |
|                    |   offences. This includes traffic               |
|                    | | arrests, traffic police summonses/notices     |
|                    |   where there are no offers of                  |
|                    | | compensation (a traffic ticket).              |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Night Courts**   | | These courts function for the convienience of |
|                    |   the working public who would                  |
|                    | | otherwise have to take time off from work in  |
|                    |   order to attend court. Operating              |
|                    | | hours are from 6pm onwards from Mondays to    |
|                    |   Fridays. There are two night courts,          |
|                    | | each with its own profile of cases. Court 26N |
|                    |   deals with summonses and notices              |
|                    | | issued by the various departments (such as    |
|                    |   HDB, CPF, etc) while Court 25N deals          |
|                    | | with road traffic offences and those brought  |
|                    |   about by the LTA.[^6]                         |

| **Coroners’        | | In the event that someone’s family dies at    |
| Court**            |   home, contact the police to attend            |
|                    | | the premises and ascertain that the death was |
|                    |   natural. If you have a family                 |
|                    | | doctor, contract them to attend the home to   |
|                    |   sign a death certificate.                     |
|                    | |                                               |
|                    | | The Coroner is a Judge of a State Court who,  |
|                    |   with the assistance of the police,            |
|                    | | conducts investigations into the              |
|                    |   circumstances in which a deceased died. The   |
|                    | | Coroner’s Court deals with cases that are     |
|                    |   classified by the Police as Coroner’s         |
|                    | | cases. The CC will hold an inquiry when there |
|                    |   is reason to suspect that a                   |
|                    | | person has died in a sudden or unnatural      |
|                    |   manner, by violence, when the cause           |
|                    | | of death is unknown and in situations where   |
|                    |   the law requires an inquiry (for              |
|                    | | example death in prison, suspected suicides,  |
|                    |   an industrial death, etc).[^7]                |
|                    | |                                               |
|                    | | Common verdicts are suicide, misadventure and |
|                    |   open verdict (where the cause of              |
|                    | | death is not clear). The body of a deceased   |
|                    |   will be brought to the Mortuary               |
|                    | | and the Police will contact you (if you had   |
|                    |   not been aware of this already).              |
|                    | | An autopsy may be conducted if the            |

Arrest, Custody & Police Bail
-----------------------------

### Arrest

**1. What is an arrest?**

An arrest is an act of detaining a person who is reasonably suspected of
having committed a criminal offence.

**2. When can the Police arrest a person?**

The Police can arrest a person who is **suspected** of having committed
a criminal offence.

**Arrests not requiring a warrant:** this is possible in cases of
serious offences such as robbery, theft, molesting, touting and
disorderly behaviour in a public place.

**Arrest requiring a warrant:** For non-serious offences like mischief
and simple hurt (such as when a person slaps another on the arm during a
dispute), an arrest can only be effected with a warrant from the Court.
A Police officer may also arrest anyone who commits an offence **in the
officer's presence**, obstructs a Police officer from executing his
duties, or is wanted by the authorities.

**3. Identification of Arresting Officer**

When arresting a suspect, a Police officer who is not in uniform should
identify himself/herself by producing his/her warrant card. He/She
should also inform the person to be arrested that he/she is a Police
officer. If in doubt, the suspect should demand to see the warrant card
to verify the identity of the arresting officer.

A specimen of the warrant card is shown below.

![image5](../images/image6.jpeg){width="1.31667in" height="2.08333in"}

If you still have doubt about the officer's identity, you should call
'999' for assistance.

**4. Making an Arrest**

When making an arrest, a Police officer will come into physical contact
with or even attempt to confine the suspect. If the suspect forcibly
resists arrest or attempts to escape, the officer may use **all
necessary means** to effect an arrest. The law does not prohibit a male
officer from arresting a female suspect.

When a suspect is being arrested, he/she should be informed of the
grounds of his/her arrest as soon as the circumstances may reasonably
permit.

**5. Will a person being arrested be searched upon arrest?**

Yes, a person being arrested may be searched upon arrest. However, only
a female Police officer should conduct a search on a female suspect.

At the Police station, the person arrested will have to surrender all
personal belongings. The items surrendered would be recorded in Form
NP304 (Acknowledgement Receipt Form) and a copy of this form will be
given to the arrested person. The Police will retain any items relevant
to the investigation until the case is concluded.

**6. How long can an arrested person be detained by the Police?**

A person can be detained for a maximum of 48 hours from the time of
his/her arrest. During the period of detention, the arrested person may
be asked to assist in Police investigations.

**7. What happens when the detention period of 48 hours is up?**

At the end of the investigation, or upon the expiry of 48 hours
(whichever is earlier), if it is not established that the arrested
person has committed an offence, he/she must be released
unconditionally.

If the investigations reveal that the arrested person has or may have
committed an offence, the Police may either produce the person in court
or release him/her on Police bail pending further investigations.

**Producing the accused in court:** If the Police produce the accused in
court, he/she may apply to the court to be released on bail. For certain
offences i.e. bailable offences, the accused is entitled to be released
on bail. However for non-bailable offences, the court will consider the
applicant to be released on bail on a case by case basis. If, the Police
require the accused for further investigations, his/her application to
be released on bail may be rejected by the court. However, the arrested
person may apply to be released on bail at his/her subsequent appearance
in court.

**Releasing the accused on bail:** If Police releases him/her on Police
bail, the accused may be released after he/she has arranged for a
bailor. The bailor must ensure that the person bailed out reports to the
Police station or attends court when required. In certain cases, Police
may also release the accused on a personal bond.

**8. Being charged for an offence after arrest**

An accused may be arrested before, during or after investigation. The
accused may be required to give a statement and also to state his
defence if accusations are made against him or if he is charged. He may
then be formally charged and produced in Court. If he is to be charged
in Court, his fingerprints may be taken by an officer and he may be
photographed at the Criminal Records Office, Criminal Investigation
Department (CID). This means that there will be a record of you at the
CID.

However, if the accused is acquitted of the offence in Court or if the
charge is withdrawn, he can write to the CID for the return of the
record of your fingerprints and negatives.

**9. Informing the accused’s family or lawyer of the arrest**

When an accused is arrested and detained, he can request to make a call
to his family or a lawyer telling them of his arrest. He may also
request visits by his family or a lawyer. These requests *may be
refused* if it will interfere with the investigation carried out by the
officers.

The law allows the accused to consult a lawyer of your choice within a
reasonable time after the accused has been arrested.

### Custody

**1. How does the Police deal with an Accused detained in Police
Custody?**[^8]

> **a. Interview:** The police will interview the accused on the facts
> and circumstances of the case.
>
> **b.** **Scene of the crime:** The police may also bring him/her to
> the scene of crime or any other places to recover evidences that may
> be relevant to the investigations.
>
> **c. Polygraph examination:** As part of their investigations, the
> Police may request the accused to undergo a polygraph examination (or
> lie-detector test).
>
> **d. Identification parade:** The Police may also request the accused
> to participate in an identification parade

The accused, if he/she so wishes, can decline to undergo a polygraph
examination or to participate in an identification parade. During the
investigations, the Police may record statements from the accused.

The interview will be conducted in a language that he understands and
the statement recorded in English. After this is done, the accused is
required to sign on the statement recorded.

Before the accused signs the statement, he should read it, or have it
read to him in a language that he understands to ensure that the
contents are true and correct.

**2. What if the accused is not feeling well or is injured whilst under
Custody?**

If the accused is sick or injured, he may request the Police to send
him/her to the hospital for medical treatment. Police will also see to
the accused’s food and drink while he/she is in their custody.

**3. Can the accused's immediate family member/s or lawyer visit him/her
during the time he/she is detained at the Police Station?**

The accused, his/her immediate family or lawyer should make the request
known to the investigating officer-in-charge of the case, who will
accede to such requests within a reasonable time after the suspect’s
arrest.

**4. What happens if the Police decides to charge the accused person in
Court?**

Where any accused is charged with an offence or officially informed that
he/she may be prosecuted for it, he/she will be served with the charge
which will be read to him/her. The accused will then be served with a
notice of warning in writing to the following effect:

*"You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for
(offence). Do you want to say anything about the charge that was just
read to you? If you keep quiet now about any fact or matter in your
defence and you reveal this fact or matter in your defence only at
trial, the judge may be less likely to believe you. This may have a bad
effect on your case in court. Therefore it may be better for you to
mention such fact or matter now. If you wish to do so, what you say will
be written down, read back to you for any mistakes to be corrected and
then signed by you."*

After the charge and notice of warning have been read to him/her, the
accused will be asked to acknowledge that he/she understands the charge
and notice of warning. If the accused does not speak or understand
English, the charge and the notice of warning will be interpreted to
him/her in the language of his/her choice.

**Answering to the charge:** The accused will then be invited to make a
statement in answer to the charge. Similarly, if he/she does not speak
or understand English, the statement would be recorded with
interpretation. If the accused decides to make a statement, the Police
officer will record his/her statement. After the statement is recorded,
it will be read over to the accused and interpreted if he/she does not
speak or understand English. The accused may also go through his/her
statement to ensure that it is true and correct, and make any necessary
amendments, additions or deletions, if he/she so wishes to, before
signing it. Thereafter, the accused will be asked to sign his statement
to confirm that the contents are true and correct and make any necessary
amendments, additions or deletions if he so wishes, before signing it.

**5. Will the accused be given a copy of the documents that he/she has
signed?**

Yes, the accused will be given a copy of the charge, notice of warning
and his/her statement in answer to the charge.

**6. Can the accused request for copies of other documents in relation
to the investigations, such as the Police Report?**

Once an accused is charged in court, he/she or his/her lawyer can
request for copies of certain reports from the Police before the
criminal proceedings. An example of these reports is the certified true
copy of the Police report pertaining to the case. For other relevant
documents, the accused or his/her lawyer may write to the Police to
request for certified true copies. The Police can furnish copies upon
request and payment of the requisite fees. This, however, is subject to
the guidelines applicable to the Police for the release of such
documents.

### Police Bail

**1. What is bail?**[^9]

Bail is a security either in cash or by an undertaking given to the
Court or to the police to ensure that the person released on bail (the
accused) returns to the Court or to the police station as and when
required to do so. The person furnishing such a security is known as a
bailor or a surety. When a person agrees to be a bailor or a surety, he
is said to be "standing bail". Depending on the amount, the Court or the
police officer may allow more than one bailor or surety for the person
bailed.

**2. When may a person be released on bail?**

While most offences allow the accused the right to bail, some offences
are non-bailable. However, a Magistrate or District Judge has the
discretion to grant bail even though the offence is non-bailable unless
the offence is one where the punishment is death or life imprisonment.

**3. How much is bail?**

The amount of bail depends very much on the seriousness of the offence.

Bail may be increased or reduced at any time by applying to the Court.
If the police asks for bail in the sum of S\$5,000.00 or more, the
ability (means) of the bailor to stand bail will first of all have to be
checked by the police and reported to the Court before granting the
bail. A bailor may show his ability to stand bail by depositing cash, or
producing fixed deposit certificates, bank passbooks, car log books,
title deeds to a property, share certificates or valuables.

**4. Where is the application for bail processed?**

All bail applications are processed by the Bail Centre in the State
Courts.

**5. When can bail be returned?**

The duties of the bailor cease when the Court, has made a decision (e.g.
when the accused is found to be not guilty of the offence (acquitted),
or is found to be guilty of the offence (convicted) and sentenced.

The bailor can then take back the items which he has deposited with the
Court. This is processed by the Finance Section of the State Courts.

**6. Can the bailor withdraw as such?**

The bailor can withdraw from standing bail for the accused at any time
before the case is completed. If the accused cannot find a substitute
bailor, he will be remanded in prison until the date of his conviction
or acquittal.

**7. What Is The Purpose Of Granting Police Bail?**[^10]

There are two functions of Police bail. The first is to ensure that the
accused on bail turns up at the Police station to assist in Police
investigations; the second is to ensure that the person on bail turns up
in court when required by the Police to do so.

**8. What is the process of granting Police Bail?**

When Police bail is offered, the person arrested can contact a bailor.
The bailor must be either a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and
more than 21 years old. The bailor must not be an undischarged bankrupt,
must not have any current proceedings in Court and should have personal
assets worth at least the bail sum. The bailor will have to satisfy the
Police that he/she is suitable to provide bail. A bailor may show
his/her ability to stand bail by depositing cash, or producing fixed
deposit certificates, bank passbooks, car log books, title deeds to a
property, share certificates or other valuables. A bailor should also
bring along his/her NRIC as proof of identity.

The bailor *must also be prepared to accept the responsibility of a
bailor until the case is over*. If the amount of bail exceeds \$10,000,
a company or a business may stand as bailor. The company's stamp will be
needed. The authorised signatory of the company will have to sign the
documents. The conditions of release on bail and the date of attendance
at the Police station or court will be explained to the accused. A copy
of the bail will be provided. Another copy will also be given to the
bailor. Once the bail has been processed, the accused will be released
from Police custody, subject to the following conditions:

1.  He/She may be asked to surrender any travel documents in his
    possession.
2.  He/She will surrender into custody, make himself available for
    investigations or attend Court at the date, time and place appointed
    for him to do so.
3.  He/She shall not commit any offence while released on bail or on
    personal bond.
4.  He/She shall not interfere with any witness or otherwise obstruct
    the course of justice whether in relation to himself or any other
    person.
5.  He/She will not be allowed to leave Singapore without the express
    consent of the Police or the Court in writing.

**9. What are the duties of a bailor?**

The bailor must ensure that:

1.  The released person surrenders to custody or makes himself available
    for investigations or attends Court at the date, time, place
    appointed for him to do so
2.  He keeps in daily communication with the released person and lodge a
    police report within 24 hours of losing contact with him
3.  The released person is within Singapore unless the released person
    has been permitted by Police to leave Singapore

If the bailor is in breach of any of his duties, the court may
confiscate the whole or a part of the bail sum.

**10. What happens when the person on bail does not report at the police
station on the given date and time?**

If on the given date and time, the person bailed does not appear at the
Police station:

a.  The Police will apply to the Court for a warrant of arrest. The
    person on bail may also be charged in court for his/her
    non-attendance for which he/she can be punished with imprisonment
    for a term of up to 1 month or with a fine which may extend to \$500
    or with both; and
b.  The bailor will be required to show cause to the Court why the bail
    amount or any part thereof should not be forfeited.

Police Investigations
---------------------

**1. What is an investigation?**[^11]

Investigation is the process of inquiry that helps Police to uncover
what happened in a crime. The Police conduct investigations to find out
the truth behind an allegation and whether there is evidence of a
criminal offence being committed.

**2. When do police start investigations?**

Investigations will commence when the Police receive information of a
criminal offence.

The Police may also commence investigations when directed by a
Magistrate, upon examining a complaint lodged by an aggrieved party at
the Crime Registry of the State Courts. For more information on
Magistrate's Complaints, you can visit the State Courts at No. 1
Havelock Square, Singapore 059724 or contact 1800-6435 5881/ 4355 for
enquiries.

**3. What kind of cases does the Police investigate?**

The Police are empowered to investigate a range of offences under the
law. Some of the more common offences investigated by the Police include
those in the Penal Code, Arms Offences Act, Computer Misuse Act,
Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Betting Act and
Common Gaming Houses Act.

**4. What happens during investigations?**

During investigations, the Police may conduct interviews to obtain
details of the case. What is told by the witness to the Police during
the interview may be recorded in a Police statement.

**5. What is recorded in a police statement?**

The statement would comprise of details of the crime or incident such as
when and where it happened, the sequence of events, details of the
suspects or offenders such as their identities, information on their
whereabouts or contact numbers, and other facts which may be helpful and
relevant to the case. If the witness does not speak or understand
English, the interview will be conducted in a language that he
understands. All statements will be recorded in English.

After the statement has been recorded, the person interviewed would be
required to sign it. Before he/she signs the statement, he/she should go
through it to ensure that its contents are true and correct, and make
any amendments, additions or deletions if he/she so wishes. Similarly,
if the person does not speak or understand English, he/she should
request for the statement to be interpreted to him/her in the language
of his/her choice to ensure that the contents are true and correct.

*\* 6. What happens if the person refuses to sign the statement?*\*

If a person refuses to sign his/her statement, he/she may be charged
with an offence for which he/she may be punished with imprisonment for a
term of up to 3 months or a fine of up to \$500 or both.

**7. Where can a statement be recorded?**

A statement is usually recorded in a Police establishment such as a
Police station, NPC or NPP. However, the Police may also record
statements at the scene of crime or in some cases, at a place convenient
to the person who is being interviewed.

**8. What if a person refuses to be interviewed?**

If a person fails to attend an interview as required by the Police, the
Magistrate may be notified for a warrant to be issued against his/her to
secure his/her attendance.

**9. What can an investigating officer do?**[^12]

Some of the powers of an investigating officer are as follows:

> a\. To order a person to go to a police station or other place for
> questioning and for taking of a statement.

b.  To record what you have to say and ask you to sign it.
c.  To search a place and take away things to be used as evidence.
d.  To seize properties which may be exhibits in the case.

Being Charged In Court
----------------------

When you are charged in Court, a charge setting out the offence alleged
to be committed by you will be read or interpreted to you. The charge
must contain **sufficient details** of the date, time, place, names of
the victims and/or the property involved in the offence alleged.

Each offence will be listed as a separate charge. You can be charged
with more than one offence. One or more persons can also be charged
together with you if they are accused of the same offence. However,
separate charges may be preferred against you. You must tell the Court
if the charge is not clear to you. If you need an interpreter, ask for
one.

After the charge is read and explained to you, you will be asked how you
wish to plead to the charge, for example, “Do you wish to plead guilty?”
(i.e. admit to the charge) or “Do you wish to claim trial?” (i.e.
contest the charge).

**Options for an accused when charged in court:**

1.  Adjournment (If undecided)
2.  Pleading guilty
3.  Claiming trial

### Adjournment

If you are unable to decide whether to plead guilty or claim trial to
the charge, or you wish to consult or be represented by a lawyer, you
can request for a short adjournment. Your lawyer will then advise you
whether you should plead guilty, or claim trial. When in doubt, always
consult a lawyer.

**1. What reasons can I give for an adjournment?**

Generally, adjournments may be granted for the following reasons:

> a\. For your lawyer to apply for the necessary papers e.g. first
> information report and to make representations on your behalf to the
> Attorney-General's Chambers.
>
> b\. For you to raise funds or make restitution, if you indicate an
> intention to plead guilty to the charge.
>
> c\. For you/your lawyer to prepare your mitigation, if you indicate an
> intention to plead guilty.
>
> d.  For you to settle personal affairs, if any.

Please note that an adjournment is granted at the Courts’ discretion. If
the Court grants an adjournment, you may be asked to furnish bail. If
bail is furnished, you will be released. If no bail is furnished, you
will be remanded at the Queenstown Remand Prison (for males) or Changi
Women’s Prison (for females) until bail is furnished or till the next
Court date.

**2. Can I be absent from Court on the appointed date?**

If you fail to attend a Court mentions orhearing a Warrant of Arrest
will be issued by the Court. This can also occur for non-payment of
fines. If you are on bail, your surety may have his bail money or
property forfeited by the Court.

The Warrant will be handed over to the Warrant Enforcement Unit (a
division of the Singapore Police Force) for them to execute. The police
will either arrest you or you may be asked to surrender yourself at the
Warrant Enforcement Unit for the warrant to be executed.

A medical certificate will not be accepted unless it:

a\. Contains the name of the medical practitioner who issued the
certificate.

b.  States the name of the hospital/clinic in which he practices.

c\. Indicates that the person to whom the certificate is issued is unable
to attend Court.

d.  Specifies the date(s) on which he is unfit to attend Court.

e\. Is signed in full by the medical practitioner and must not be merely
initialled.

f\. Is authenticated by a rubber stamp showing the medical practitioner's
full name and designation in the hospital or clinic.

**4. As a condition of the Warrant of Arrest, bail may or may not be
offered upon arrest**

If no bail is offered, you will be brought to Court within 48 hours of
your arrest.

If bail is offered, you will be asked to furnish the bail sum before you
may be released to attend Court on a specified date. If you are unable
to find a bailor, you will be brought to Court within 48 hours of your
arrest.

In certain cases, you may be disqualified from holding or obtaining a
driving licence pending your arrest.

**5. What happens when I am arrested?**

Once the warrant is executed and you are before the court, you will be
asked to explain your absence in court on the previous hearing date. The
court will also deal with the charges against you if you are ready to
give a plea. If you are also facing a show cause action, the court may
impose a fine if no satisfactory reasons are given for your absence.

If you fail to turn up in court even after the warrant is executed, in
certain cases for example where you face charges under the Road Traffic
Act (Cap 276) or The Parking Places Act (Cap 214), you may be
disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence until the
matter against you is concluded or for such other period as the Court
thinks fit.

**6. Notice to Surety**

If you are on bail and a Warrant of Arrest has been ordered by the
Court, a Notice to Surety to Show Cause will be issued against your
surety and the matter fixed for mention in Court. Your surety may have
his bail money or property forfeited by the court if he fails to give a
satisfactory explanation for your absence from Court.

### *Pleading Guilty*

If you plead guilty to the charge, you must admit fully the offence
alleged to have been committed by you. You must also understand the
nature and the consequences of your plea i.e. you must be aware of the
minimum and maximum punishments you face under the charge and be
prepared to accept whatever punishment the Court may give.

The Prosecutor will then ask that the Statement of Facts be read to you.
If you do not agree with what is stated in the Statement of Facts, you
must tell the Court. The Court will ask you whether you disagree with
the Statement of Facts totally or in part. If you disagree with the
Statement of Facts (unless what you disagree with is not important), the
Court will not accept your plea of guilt and will direct you to claim
trial to the charge.

**1. What are the consequences of pleading guilty?**

When the Accused decides to plead guilty, this means he accepts without
qualification the Statement of Facts (SOF) which constitute the
ingredients of the charge and the facts in relation to how the offence
was committed, and that he has committed the offence to which he is
pleading guilty. As a consequence of the Accused’s plea, a conviction
will be recorded against the Accused and the Court will impose a
sentence on the Accused. The conviction/sentence forms part of the
Accused’s records saves for spent convictions. The accused *may* be
shown leniency by the Court if he pleads guilty at an early stage, save
for circumstances where the Accused was caught red-handed in the
commission of the offence.

At any stage of proceedings, the Accused may retract his plea of guilt.
The defence counsel may make an application for the Accused’s plea to be
retracted before sentencing. If sentencing has taken place, defence
counsel may need to take a criminal motion. Plea bargaining with the
Prosecution may lead to charges being amended and thus the Accused may
plead guilty to a lesser charge. Pleading guilty, like cooperation with
police, first time offending, restitution and remorse, are some og the
mitigating of factors that can assist the Court in arriving at the
appropriate sentence.

**2. Previous convictions**

After you have pleaded guilty to the charge and admitted the Statement
of Facts, the Prosecutor will tell the Court if you have any previous
convictions. You will be asked whether you admit to those convictions.
Those convictions may be considered by the Court when sentencing you.

**3. Mitigation**

You will then be asked by the Court if you wish to state any facts or
circumstances to explain the reason/s why you committed the offence and
why the Court should be lenient to you. For example; family background,
education, medical background, employment, recovery of all or some of
the property and compensation given to the victim.

**4. Victim Impact Statement**

Before the Court decides on a sentence, the Prosecutor may apply to read
to the Court a Victim Impact Statement. This is a recently introduced
procedure by which the Court may assess the effect of the offences on
the victim and then consider an appropriate sentence.

### *Claiming Trial*

If you decide to claim trial to the charge, the Court will set aside a
date for trial. Your trial may be fixed in another Court on a separate
occasion. You may be required to furnish Court bail to ensure your
attendance in Court.

**1. What happens if I claim trial?**

The Court will fix the case for a pre-trial conference. The purpose of
the pre-trial conference is to ascertain if a case is ready for trial.
At the pre-trial conference, you will be asked on the number of witness
you will be calling in support of your defence. Once the case is ready
for trial, the matter will be fixed for hearing. After this stage the
Court will not allow any adjournments of the matter.

**2. What does claiming trial mean?**

If you claim trial, this means that you dispute the charge and would
like a court hearing to defend yourself. You will be asked if you wish
to engage a lawyer or if you wish to defend yourself in person. If you
wish to engage a lawyer, you will be given time to do so. Once the
parties are ready, the Court may fix the case for a pre-trial conference
or for trial.

**4. If you claim trial, you are expected to bring along evidence
including witnesses (if any) in support of your defence on the day of
the trial.**

At the end of the trial, the Court will decide whether you are guilty.
If the Court finds that you are guilty of the offence, you will be asked
if you have any mitigating facts to present to the court. Thereafter,
the court will pass its sentence, which may either be a fine or
imprisonment or both. Where the law provides a sentence of caning, the
Court may order such a sentence if you are a male who is below 50 years
of age.

If the Court finds that you not guilty, you will be acquitted and
discharged

On the day of the trial, you may be required by the Court to state your
defence after the Prosecution has completed its case against you. If you
are unable to do so, you will be found guilty and convicted.

If you are able to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case
you will be acquitted and released immediately.

**5. Appeal**

If you are not satisfied either with your sentence or conviction or
both, you can file an appeal to the High Court. You have 10 days from
the date of the conviction or sentence to file the appeal.

As a general rule, if you have already pleaded guilty to the charge, you
can only appeal against the sentence.

**6. Can I ask for instalment payments of a fine?**

You may apply to the court to pay the fine(s) imposed by instalments. If
the Court does not grant your application, you will have to serve the
default imprisonment sentence if you are unable to pay the fine in full.
In cases where the Court grants instalment payments and you fail to pay
the instalment due, you will also have to serve the applicable period of
default imprisonment sentence.

### How To File A Notice Of Appeal

**For cases where the Accused is charged on or after 2 Jan 2011**

**Procedure**[^13]

1.  Filing of a Notice of Appeal
2.  Service of Grounds of Decision and Notes of Evidence
3.  Filing of the Petition of Appeal

**Step 1: Filing of a Notice of Appeal**

Any sentence or order pronounced by the District Court or Magistrate
Court in any criminal case can be appealed to the High Court. The Notice
of Appeal must be filed at the Appeals Counter in the Crime Registry of
State Courts within 14 calendar days from the time the sentence or order
is made.

Where an accused has admitted to the offence and is dissatisfied with
the sentence passed by the Judge, he may only file an appeal against the
sentence. If he decides to retract his plea of guilt after the sentence
has been passed, he must file a Criminal Revision at the High Court to
set aside the conviction.

For private summons proceedings, a complainant seeking to file an appeal
against an acquittal and sentence must first seek the Attorney-General’s
consent in writing and produce his consent when filing the Notice of
Appeal.

The appeal can only be filed by a party to the case or matter, who is
referred to as the Appellant. The Appellant needs to complete and submit
1 set of the Notice of Appeal. The Notice of Appeal must contain an
address to which any notices or documents connected with the appeal may
be served.

If the Appellant is represented by a lawyer, the lawyer’s name, the law
firm’s reference, address, telephone and fax number must be provided in
the Notice of Appeal.

The completed form should be submitted (**within 14 calendar days**) at
the Appeals Counter in Crime Registry and a fee of S\$50 is required to
be paid at the time of submission. Where the Appellant is a company, a
letter of authorization is required from the company authorizing the
representative of the company who signs on the Notice of Appeal.

When the timeline for filling the Notice of Appeal has lapsed and the
Appellant still wishes to file his/her appeal, he/she can only do so by
filing a Criminal Notion in the High Court applying for extension of
time to file his/her appeal. If he/she obtains an approval from High
Court, he/she may file his/her appeal at the State Courts.

**Step 2: Service of Grounds of Decision & Notes of Evidence**

When the Notice of Appeal is filed, the Judge will be informed and the
Grounds of Decision for the case will be prepared. When the Grounds of
Decision is ready, a copy of it with the Notes of Evidence of the case
will be served on the Appellant or his lawyer via Speed Post.

The Appellant is entitled to the first set of record of proceedings and
Grounds of Decision. Subsequent sets of record of proceeding, Grounds of
Decision and exhibits tendered during hearing will be charged as
follows: \$0.50 for each page subject to a minimum of \$10.

**Step 3: Filing of the Petition of Appeal**

Having been served with the Grounds of Decision and Notes of Evidence,
the Appellant must file a Petition of Appeal at the Appeals Counter in
Crime Registry within 14 calendar days of the service of the documents
if he intends to proceed with the appeal.

If the timeline for filing the Petition of Appeal has lapsed and the
Appellant wants to file his Petition of Appeal, he/she must file a
Criminal Motion at the High Court for extension of time to file his/her
Petition of Appeal.

If a petition is not filed within 14 days of service of the Grounds of
Decision, the appeal shall be deemed withdrawn and the trial court shall
enforce its sentence or order.

If the Appellant is on bail pending his/her appeal against a sentence of
imprisonment, the Appellant must surrender to the Court that had
sentenced him/her on the 15^th^ day after the service of the Grounds of
Decision, failing which, a Warrant of Arrest will be issued.

The Warrant Enforcement Unit (a division of the Singapore Police Force)
will arrest and produce the Appellant in court. Thereafter, the
Appellant will be handed over to the Prisons Department for the sentence
to be served.

The High Court will inform the Appellant of the hearing dates of the
appeal.

Court Bail
----------

**1. What is Court Bail?**[^14]

It is an amount of money or property required to be deposited with the
Court, in order for the accused person to be released from custody of
the Prison. The amount and nature of the bail will be decided by the
Judge.

Bail serves as an assurance of the accused person’s attendance when
required by the Court. If an accused person who is on bail, fails to
appear in Court when so required, it can cause the bail money to be
forfeited.

**2. Can the Accused person leave Singapore while on Court Bail?**

The accused person is not allowed to leave Singapore while he is on
Court Bail. If the accused person wishes to leave Singapore, he must
first make a written application stating his reasons, destination and
duration. Only upon formal approval being granted by the Court can he
then leave Singapore.

**3. Who grants Court Bail?**

The Judge presiding at the respective Court has the authority to grant
bail.

**4. Who can apply to stand as Surety?**

|      | minimum caning of 12 strokes   |                             |
|      | \*                             |                             |
+------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------+

\* To consider scaling bail amount upwards if offence is punishable with
mandatory minimum imprisonment term AND caning

**Note:** Where the offence relates to property and the property is not
recovered, the bail amount should generally bear some proportion to the
value of the unrecovered property

The suggested bail quanta listed above are intended only to serve as
**general guidelines**. They may be adjusted upwards or downwards
depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, bearing in mind
considerations such as: (a) the seriousness of the offence(s) –
including the likely sentence upon conviction and any mandatory
sentences; (b) the number of charges involved; (c) the accused’s
antecedents (if any); (d) the accused’s individual circumstances,
including his means of raising bail; (e) where the offence relates to
property, the benefits obtained or loss caused by the accused, including
the value of any unrecovered property; (f) whether the accused
surrendered himself.

The court will also evaluate, based on available evidence, the
likelihood of the accused absconding if he is released on bail and
consider what would be an appropriate amount to secure his attendance.
The court may also set additional conditions to court bail such as
requiring the accused to refrain from attending a premise or setting
foot on a place they specify, as well as forcing them to avoid
communicating with certain people, etc.

The Prosecuting Officer may suggest a bail amount. If the accused person
or his counsel is of the view that the amount is too high, he may make a
counter proposal. The Court may proceed to hear submissions from both
sides before determining the amount. The outcome is subject to the
discretion of the Judge. Once bail is granted, the accused person would
be remanded in prison until the bail processing is completed at the Bail
Centre. Such bail processing is completed when the bail bond is
executed.

**8. What are the types of collateral that can be used/pledged as Court
Bail?**

The following collaterals that can be pledged depends on the bail amount
granted, and any conditions that may be imposed by the Court:

  Bail Amount            Cash       Savings Acct       Fixed Deposit        Personal Property \*\*
  ---------------------- ---------- ------------------ -------------------- ------------------------------
  Below \$1000\*         NA         NA                 NA                   NA
  \$1001 to \$5000       √          √                  √                    √
  \$5001 to \$10000      √          √                  √                    √\*\*\*
  \$10,001 & above       √          √                  √                    X

\* For bail amounts of \$1000 and below, no collateral is required.

\*\* Pledging of movable personal property, such as household items or
jewellery, is by way of a sworn affidavit. (Such an affidavit will be
prepared by the Bail Officer for the Surety’s attestation before a
Commissioner for Oaths).

\*\*\* If personal property is used the surety will have to report in
person to the Investigating Officer of the case, with the affidavit for
verification purposes. Generally, the Investigating Officer may require
the surety to submit documentary proof of ownership by the
^1^surety.[^15] If the surety provides cash for at least half of the
bail amount, such verification by the Investigating Officer will not be
required.

**9. What is verification?**

It is a process to confirm that the current market value of the personal
property pledged by the surety is worth the bail amount ordered by the
Court. The verification process is as follows:

a.  Verification is conducted by the Investigating Officer of the case.
b.  The Bail Officer will prepare the affidavit, based on the
    information given by the surety.
c.  The affidavit is then given to the surety in a sealed envelope with
    a direction that the surety is to report personally at the relevant
    law enforcement agency for the verification by the Investigating
    Officer.
d.  The Investigating Officer will assess whether the personal property
    is worth the bail amount and then endorse on the reverse side of the
    affidavit the outcome of his verification.
e.  The endorsed affidavit will be returned to the surety in a sealed
    envelope with a direction that the surety is to return to the Bail
    Centre with it.
f.  Upon the surety’s return, the Bail Centre will confirm whether the
    endorsed amount is worth the bail amount. If it is, the Bail Officer
    would then prepare the bail bond and have it executed before the
    Duty Judge.
g.  If however the affidavit has been endorsed as not worth the bail
    amount, the surety will be informed. The surety can then make
    alternative arrangements like using cash or bank account. If the
    surety decides to add further additional personal property the
    verification process will have to be reactivated.

**10. What happens in Court Bail proceedings?**

The Bail Officer will:

a.  Prepare the bail bond and the affidavit, once the amount and method
    of payment have been ascertained, as well as the completion of the
    verification (if applicable), as explained above.
b.  Explain to the surety his responsibilities of the surety and the
    consequences when the conditions of the bail are breached.
c.  Inform him of the next mention or trial date.
d.  Forward the bail bond by fax to the Police Lock-Up for the accused
    person to sign
e.  Thereafter - The surety will appear before the Duty Judge, and the
    accused person will be present through the video-link.
f.  The Duty Judge will confirm with the accused person and his surety
    that they are aware of the mention or trial date and obtain surety’s
    confirmation that he or she is aware of his/her duties
g.  Once the Duty Judge accepts the surety’s application, the accused
    person would be released on bail.

**11. What are the consequences of breaching Court Bail?**

**Accused Person:** If the accused person fails to appear in Court on
the required date and time, the Court will issue a Warrant of Arrest
against him. This may result in bail being refused in future.

**Surety:** A Notice to Show Cause will be issued to the surety to
attend Court on a specified date and time and to explain to the Judge as
to why the bail amount should not be forfeited. If the Judge orders a
forfeiture of any bail amount, and if the forfeited sum is not paid, the
Court may proceed to recover the amount by issuing a Warrant of
Attachment. A Warrant of Attachment is an enforcement procedure to
recover the monies due, by way of sale of the property/properties
belonging to the surety. If the forfeited sum cannot be recovered fully
by such attachment and sale, the surety is liable to imprisonment for a
term, which may extend to 6 months.

**12. How does a surety obtain a release/refund of the Court Bail?**

The collateral for the bail amount provided by the surety and retained
by the Court would only be released or refunded to the surety upon the
final conclusion of the case.

If a fixed deposit or savings account was used for purposes of bail, the
relevant document which was submitted by the surety can be collected
from the Finance Section, which is located on the ground floor of the
Havelock Square Complex. Before proceeding to the Finance Section, the
surety must first obtain a written confirmation from the officer of the
Court (where the case was concluded) authorizing the Finance Section to
release the collateral.

If cash was used the bail amount will be refunded to the surety’s bank
account upon the final conclusion of the case. If the surety has an
account with DBS, OCBC or UOB the refund to the surety would be within
15 working days. If surety has accounts with other banks there will be
an additional 8 working days’ processing time. Please note that where
cash is used as collateral, the refund will only be made to the surety’s
bank account. Requests for refunds in cash or by way of cheque or for
payment to be directed to any other person will not be allowed.

**13. How can one discharge the duties of a surety before the conclusion
of the case?**

The surety can make an oral application in Court, usually on the day
that the case is next mentioned or heard. A surety may also write to the
Court for the matter to be fixed for mention to enable him to make the
necessary application. Both the accused person and the surety must be
present at the mention date. Upon the discharge of the surety, the
accused person would be remanded in prison until or unless another
surety is found.

The Criminal Legal Aid Scheme
-----------------------------

**What is CLAS?**

The Criminal Legal Aid Scheme was set up in September 1985 as a project
run by the Law Society of Singapore. It continues to be administered by
the Law Society with a dedicated team of full-time staff.

CLAS fulfils one of the purposes of the Law Society which is to provide
criminal legal assistance to the poor and needy in non-capital charges.

CLAS is different from the Legal Aid Bureau which is government-run. The
Bureau provides legal aid and advice on civil but not criminal cases and
applicants are subject to a means and merits test.

CLAS fulfils one of the purposes of the Law Society which is to provide
criminal legal assistance to the poor and needy in non-capital charges.

Magistrate’s Complaints
-----------------------

A Magistrate’s Complaint is a written complaint lodged by a person (the
Complainant) against one or more persons (the Respondents) whom he
believes has committed a criminal offence against him.[^16]

### How To File A Magistrate’s Complaint

![image6](../images/image7.png){width="6.00000in" height="4.40000in"}

**Step 1: Filing of a Magistrates' Complaint**[^17]

A Magistrates Complaint can be filed by any person who wishes to seek
redress for an offence that they believe has been committed against them
(broad range i.e. cheating, tenancy complaints, and suspected
illegality).

The complaint should be made on the [Standard Complaint
form](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/Data/Files/File/forms/Criminal/Form_MagistrateComplaint.pdf).
A Court interpreter will assist to complete the form if the complainant
is unable to do so himself in English.

The completed form should be submitted to the Complaints Counter of the
Crime Registry, together with:

> 1.  A copy of a Police report, if any, **and**
> 2.  A photocopy of the Complainant’s NRIC

The Complainant has to affirm or swear to the truth and accuracy of the
matters stated in the application form before a Magistrate. If the
Magistrate is satisfied that the application is in order, he may do any
of the following:

> 1.  Issue a Notice to both the Complainant and Respondent.
>
> 2\. If the Respondent’s address or particulars are not available, direct
> the police to ascertain the particulars and thereafter issue a Notice to
> both the Complainant and Respondent.
>
> 3\. Issue a Summons against the Respondent provided the Charge(s) are
> available.
>
> 4.  Direct the police to investigate the Complaint.

5.  Dismiss the Complaint.

The Complainant may apply to withdraw his complaint at any time
**before** a summons is issued against the Respondent. If the summons
has been issued, the Complainant may apply to withdraw the summons in
open Court on an appointed court date.

**Step 2: Issue of Notices**

When the Judge directs that a Notice be issued to both the Complainant
and the Respondent, the Crime Registry will prepare the Notices
informing parties of the date and time they are required to appear
before a Magistrate in chambers for what is known as Criminal Mediation.
At this stage, no fee is payable by the Complainant.

**Step 3: Criminal Mediation**

When a Magistrate directs that a Notice be issued to both
the Complainant and the Respondent, it means that the matter is fixed
for criminal mediation before a Magistrate in Chambers.  

The Complainant must be present on the day of the criminal
mediation. Otherwise, it will be deemed that the Complainant is no
longer interested  in pursuing the complaint and the Magistrate will
strike out the complaint.

When both parties appear before Magistrate for criminal mediation, the
following may occur:

a.  The Magistrate may refer both parties to the Community
    Mediation Centre (CMC). The CMC has a panel of trained mediators who
    are respected members society from all walks of life. If the matter
    is settled at CMC, parties will sign a Settlement Agreement. If
    settlement is not reached, fresh notices will be sent to the
    Complainant and the Respondent to appear before the Magistrate on
    another day.
b.  The Magistrate may mediate the matter. If a settlement is reached,
    the complaint will be withdrawn and no further action will be taken.
    If there is no settlement, the Complainant may wish to proceed to
    trial by way of a private summons. A Summons will be issued once the
    Complainant has prepared the necessary charges against the
    Respondent. There is a fee of \$20 payable for each Summons.
c.  The Magistrate may refer the Complainant and the Respondent to a
    Court Mediator for mediation. Depending on the outcome of the
    mediation, the follow-up actions will be similar to paragraph (b)
    above.  

**Step 4: Service of Summons**

Where a Summons is issued, the Complainant has to pay \$20 for the
issuance of the Summons.  The Complainant must serve the Summons on the
Respondent. This is to give the Respondent notice that a Complaint has
been started against him. Service of Summons can be done in the
following ways:

(1) Personal service: an authorised person (usually the Court Process
    Server if the Complainant does not have a lawyer) must hand the
    Summons to the Respondent personally. The Complainant will have to
    accompany the Court process server to serve the summons on the
    respondent. Transport charges for the service of the Summons to be
    borne by the Complainant.  

    If the above service fails, the process server may obtain the
    Court's approval to serve the Summons by:

(2) Leaving the Summons with an adult member of the Respondent's
    household; or
(3) Posting the Summons on the front door of the Respondent's place of
    residence.

It should be noted that a summons cannot be served on a Respondent who
is residing outside of Singapore. Also, if the Complainant does not know
the current address of the Respondent, the court will try to ascertain
the address through available official records to effect service
accordingly.  

However, if it can be shown that the Respondent is no longer residing at
the address that is reflected in available official records, the
Complainant has a duty to find out the Respondent's current address. If
the address cannot be determined, the Complaint cannot proceed.

**Step 5: Hearing of Summons**

The case will proceed to hearing once the Summons has been served on the
Respondent. At the hearing, the Respondent will be asked to enter a plea
of guilty or not guilty. If the Respondent pleads guilty, the Court will
pass a sentence immediately.

The matter will proceed to trial if the Respondent and has to give
evidence in open court to prove their respective cases. The usual
procedures of calling witnesses to support their case as well as the
cross examining of witnesses will take place in open court.
Cross-examination refers to the questioning of witnesses on what is said
in evidence by the other party or his lawyer. The respective parties or
lawyers representing the case will then present a summary of the
case with the supporting arguments to the trial judge. The duration of
the trial may take one or several days depending on the complexity of
the case. At the of the hearing, the court will decide whether the
Respondent is guilty of the offences as charged.

In the event the Respondent is absent on the day of the trial, the court
will issue a Warrant of arrest against him. If a Warrant of Arrest is
issued, the matter will be handed over to the Warrant Enforcement
Unit\* (a division of the Singapore Police Force) for execution. The
process of the Warrant of Arrest may not be immediate. Once it is
carried out, the police will arrest the Respondent and produce him in
court. The court will offer the option to post bail for the Respondent
and the case will be re-fixed for mediation.

Spent Criminal Records
----------------------

Criminal Records

Under the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap. 268) (‘RCA’), the Police
keep records in the Register of Criminals of persons convicted of any
crime specified in the First and Second Schedules of the Act. These
include personal particulars such as the photograph, finger impressions
and conviction records. This is a record for life which is also used by
the courts when sentencing repeat offenders. The RCA allows record of a
conviction for a less serious crime to be *considered as spent* if the
person stays clean after a specified period in order to aid their
re-integration into society.

**What kinds of offences are able to be registered?**

Offences which can be registered are offences listed in the First and
Second Schedules of the Registration of Criminals Act, such as murder,
kidnapping, rape, theft, cheating, trespass, mischief, forgery,
counterfeiting, and offences under Acts such as the Misuse of Drugs Act,
Prevention of Corruption Act, and Women’s Charter and so on.

Spent Criminal Records

All records in the register of any person convicted within Singapore of
any crime shall be capable of becoming spent in accordance with the
requirements as set out in S7B of the RCA, subject to S7C. Those who
qualify will be automatically have their criminal records spent and
there is no need to apply to have it reviewed.

**Requirements:**

(1) Satisfy a crime-free period: As defined in the RCA, “crime-free
    period” means a period not less than 5 consecutive years starting
    from the relevant date applicable to a person, during which the
    person (a) has not been convicted of a crime; (b) has not been
    unlawfully at large in relation to any crime; (c) has not been
    detained or subject to police supervision under S30 of the Criminal
    Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap. 67); and (d) has not been
    subject to a supervision order or admitted to an approved
    institution under the Misuse of Drugs Act, or admitted to an
    approved centre at the Intoxicating Substances Act.

Imprisonment due to default of payment for the fine is not regarded as a
“term of imprisonment” for the purpose of determining the date of the
crime-free period. Hence, if a person is imprisoned because he is unable
to pay a fine, his crime-free period starts from the date which the
sentence was passed and not the date of release from imprisonment.

(1) A person must not be disqualified from having his record spent on
    any of the grounds in S7C, which are:
    a.  His conviction was for any offence specified in the Third
        Schedule, which are offences for which a criminal record cannot
        be spent. Offences under the Third Schedule include drug
        trafficking, rioting, culpable homicide, cause of grievous hurt,
        sexual offences, outrage of modesty or gang-robbery.
    b.  The sentence imposed on him for that conviction included:
        i.  A term of imprisonment exceeding 3 months; or
        ii. A fine exceeding \$2000
    c.  That conviction was for a crime committed within 5 years after
        he had been released from:
        i.  An approved institution under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
        ii. An approved centre under the Intoxicating Substances Act.
    d.  He has been detained or subject to a police supervision under
        S30 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap. 67) at
        any time before that conviction.
    e.  He has a warrant of arrest for any offence issued against him
        which remains unexecuted.
    f.  He has records in the register of more than one conviction,
        whether or not these convictions arise from the same particular
        occasion.
    g.  He has had any previous record in the register of any of his
        convictions become spent under S7B or treated as spent under S7D
(2) A person who is disqualified under S7C from having the record in the
    register of his conviction within Singapore for any crime becoming
    spent may, at any time, apply to the Commissioner of Police to have
    the record treated as spent. (S7D of the RCA).

### Consequences of Criminal Record Being Treated as Spent

A person who had his criminal record spent is *deemed to have no such
record and may lawfully choose not to disclose the spent record for all
purposes*, except during:

a\. An Investigation into an offence by a person authorised under any
written law to carry out such investigation.

b.  Any prosecution against the person for any offence.
c.  Any proceedings before a court.

d\. Any application by a person for an appointment to or employment in
any office, or for admission to any profession or vocation, from which
the person may be disqualified under any written law by reason of his
conviction.

**1. How can a person find out if his/ her criminal records are spent?**

In order to find out whether a person’s criminal record has been marked
spent, he can:

a.  Make an appointment via the police hotline 6557 5700 during office
    hours to meet the counter staff of Police Records Office located at
    the Police Cantonment Complex. Due to the confidentiality of the
    information, no disclosures will be made on the phone.
b.  Alternatively, the electronic portal allows ex-offenders to check
    whether their personal criminal records have been marked as spent
    online, using the NRIC number as the login ID and SingPass as the
    authentication password[^18]

**2. Effect of spent criminal records overseas – including employment,
immigration, studies, adoption**

The Registration of Criminals Act is a domestic law. If a person is
employed by an employer in Singapore under Singapore law, RCA applies
even if he is posted overseas, and he may lawfully not disclose a spent
record under Singapore law. However, if his employment is conducted
under governance of another country’s law, RCA does not automatically
apply and will depend on the law in the relevant foreign country.

**4. If a person’s criminal record is spent, can he answer “no” when
asked if he has a criminal record in an employment application?**

Yes, since his criminal record has been rendered spent, he can lawfully
say that he has no criminal record.

**5. If a person’s criminal record is spent, can he answer “no” when
asked if he has been convicted in a court of law in an employment
application?**

A person’s criminal record may be spent, but it does not change the fact
that he had been convicted before. Hence, the person has to admit to
having been convicted in a court of law.

**6. What will happen to a person's registrable particulars such as
fingerprints, photographs and body samples records if his criminal
record is rendered spent?**

A criminal record that has been rendered spent is not erased from the
Register of Criminals. Thus the registrable particulars collected as
part of that criminal record will still remain in the Register of
Criminals kept by the Police but the record will be marked as spent.

**7. Will pending cases against me during or after the 5-year crime-free
period affect my chances of my criminal record of a previous conviction
being rendered spent?**

A criminal record becomes spent when a person satisfies a crime-free
period of 5 years. If, during the 5-year period, the person is convicted
in court of another registrable offence, or if he is unlawfully at large
in respect of a registrable offence, his record will not become spent.
In addition, if a person has an outstanding warrant of arrest, he will
be disqualified from having his record spent as long as the warrant
remains outstanding. However, if the person has satisfied the crime-free
period, his record will become spent and any subsequent conviction or
warrant of arrest will not revive the earlier record.

**8. Will a person who had previously been placed on probation be
eligible for his criminal record to be rendered spent?**

A probation is not considered a conviction and thus not a criminal
record. A person who was placed on probation for committing an offence
does not have a criminal record relating to that offence. His probation
also does not disqualify him from having a subsequent record of a
conviction for another offence rendered spent.

**9. Are there exceptions where the criminal records are relevant even
when spent?**

The criminal records that can become spent are those of minor offences.
However, there may be some sensitive professions or appointments from
which a person may be disqualified by reason of his past convictions.
Certain laws, such as the Medical Registration Act and others, already
stipulate that a person convicted of certain offences, such as those
involving dishonesty, be disqualified from either joining the profession
or being appointed to certain posts within the profession.

This amendment to the Registration of Criminals Act will not displace
any of the existing requirements in the law for the various professions.
In other words, the criteria for joining or being appointed to these
professions or positions is determined by the specific laws relating to
those professions or appointments.

**10. Can a person's criminal record be rendered spent if he has just
missed the criteria by a few days or by a few hundred dollars? Is there
an appeal channel?**

A person who is disqualified by the conditions stated in section 7C of
the Registration of Criminals Act can apply to the Commissioner of
Police under section 7D of the RCA for their criminal records to be
rendered spent.

**11. What is the Home Team doing to educate the public and employers on
giving ex-offenders a second chance?**

The Home Team will engage employers to encourage them to ask about
"criminal records" instead of "previous convictions" in their employment
questionnaires, if they require information about the criminal history
of potential employees.

**12. Will the public be in danger (compromise on public safety) because
ex-offenders are getting their records spent, for this may mean that
there is no prior knowledge of their criminal past and hence little room
for taking precautions against them re-offending in future?**

While the government is committed to giving ex-offenders a second
chance, public safety remains the key concern. This is why only records
of less serious crimes are allowed to be rendered spent. These are very
minor crimes such as shop theft where public safety would not be
compromised even with the implementation of the policy to render these
records spent. Criminal records of serious crimes such as culpable
homicide and drug trafficking will not qualify to be rendered spent.

**13. Why can't the government take a more liberal approach by expunging
the criminal record of minor offences?**

There is a need to strike a balance between the interest of ex-offenders
and the interest of employers and the concerns of society. As this is a
new initiative, the government has decided to adopt a more cautious
approach by providing for records to be spent instead of expunged. The
scheme will be regularly reviewed and the expunging of criminal records
can be considered in the future.

Juvenile Crimes/Offences
------------------------

**1. Power of the Court on Juvenile Arrest Cases (JAC)**

The Juvenile Court has the power to make orders for juveniles where an
offence has been proved, or where the juvenile admits the facts
constituting the offence under s44 of the Children and Young Persons Act
(CYPA). During this process, the Juvenile Court takes into consideration
every individual offenders strengths and limitations to make the orders.

In broad terms, the factors that the Juvenile Court considers when
making the order include:

-   Rehabilitation and reformation of the offender
-   Removal of him/her from undesirable surroundings
-   Promoting his/her education and welfare
-   Compensation of victim(s) involved
-   Protection of public
-   Minimising the risk of further offending by the offender
-   Punishment of the offender

The Juvenile Court is empowered with the following options to deal with
a juvenile offender upon a finding of guilt under s44 of the CYPA:

-   Discharge the offender
-   Commit the offender to the care of a relative or other fit person
-   Offender’s parent or guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
    care and guardianship
-   Community service order
-   Probation order
-   Detention at a Place of Detention
-   Weekend Detention at a Place of Detention or Approved Institution
-   Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre
-   Reformative Training Centre
-   Payment of a fine, damages or costs

**2. Family Conferencing**

Under s45 of the CYPA, the Juvenile Court Magistrate may order that a
Family conference be convened to deal with an offender found guilty of
an offence. This order is made if in respect of the offender’s family
background, general conduct, home surroundings, school record, medical
history and state of development of the offender, the court is satisfied
that it would be in the best interests of the offender that he/she be
dealt with by a Family conference.

Family Conference consists of a Court appointed facilitator, the
offender and family, the probation officer, police investigation and
prosecuting officers, victim and family, school representatives,
psychologists and other community representatives. The results and
recommendations of the Family Conference are made to the Magistrate who
then makes appropriate orders in open Court. If it is deemed
appropriate, under s46 of the CYPA, the Court may make an additional
order requiring either or both the Child or Young Person and the Parent
or Guardian thereof to undergo counselling, psychotherapy or other
appropriate programmes.
