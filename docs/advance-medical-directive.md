ADVANCE MEDICAL DIRECTIVE
=========================

Introduction

The **“Advance Medical Directive Act”** is (Chapter 4A, 1997 Revised
Edition) is the law to *“provide for, and give legal effect to, advance
directives to medical practitioners against artificial prolongation of
the dying process and for matters connected therewith.*”

An Advance Medical Directive ("AMD") is a legal document signed by a
person in advance, which informs the doctor that he objects to the use
of extraordinary life-sustaining treatment to prolong his life where he
becomes terminally ill and unconscious or incapable of exercising
rational judgment.

"Extraordinary lifesaving treatment" is any medical procedure or measure
which only prolongs the process of dying when death is imminent, when
administered to a terminally-ill patient. Palliative care is excluded.

"Terminal illness" is defined as an incurable condition caused by injury
or disease from which there is no reasonable prospect of a temporary or
permanent recovery.

Creating an Advance Medical Directive
-------------------------------------

An AMD can be created at any time by any person, who is -

1.  21 years or older;
2.  Of sound mental mind.

To be valid, the AMD must be in the prescribed form, which can be
obtained from clinics, polyclinics, hospitals or the Ministry of Health
website -

1.  In writing;
2.  Witnessed by two (2) witnesses, one of which must be a doctor
    registered with the Singapore Medical Council and the other must be
    at least 21 years old;
3.  Returned to the Registrar of AMD, Ministry of Health upon
    completion.

Further, both witnesses cannot have any vested interests in the death of
the creator of the AMD. The witnesses must not -

• Be a beneficiary of the will or any insurance policy taken out by the

:   creator of the AMD;

• Have any interest under any instrument of which the creator of the AMD

:   is a donor, settlor or grantor;

• Be entitled as an intestate beneficiary to the estate of the creator
of the AMD;

• Be entitled to an interest in the CPF or other provident fund

:   belonging to the creator of the AMD; and

• Have registered an objection to the AMD.

A relative to the creator of the AMD can be a witness, as long as he
does not have any vested interests as listed above.

How AMD works
-------------

The AMD is confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone, except if
the creator of the AMD has authorised specific persons in writing.

An AMD is activated in the event the creator of the AMD is -

1.  Suffering from a terminal illness;
2.  Unconscious or incapable of exercising rational judgment;
3.  To the point where he/she is unable to communicate his/her wishes to
    the doctor.

The doctor will then check the AMD Registry to see if an AMD has been
registered. If so, extraordinary life-sustaining treatment will not be
applied or given to the creator of the AMD.

An AMD is confidential, and therefore the doctor cannot ask their
patient whether or not an AMD has been created.

To determine whether a patient is "terminally ill" -

1.  Three doctors, including the doctor who is responsible for the
    treatment of the patient, must unanimously certify that the patient
    is terminally ill;
2.  At least 2 out of the 3 doctors must be specialists;
3.  If these doctors cannot unanimously agree, then the matter is
    referred for determination to a committee of 3 specialists appointed
    by the Director of Medical Services from among the panel of
    specialists appointed by the Minister;
4.  If the second panel of 3 doctors cannot unanimously agree, the
    patient shall be presumed not to be terminally ill and the AMD will
    not take effect.

Revoking an AMD
---------------

An AMD can be revoked at any time in the presence of at least one
witness, by -

1.  Completing the AMD revocation form; or
2.  Writing a letter to the Registrar of AMD to revoke it.

If the creator of the AMD is unable to write, the AMD can be revoked
orally or in any other way in which he can communicate. It is then the
responsibility of the witness to the revocation to submit the notice of
revocation using the revocation form or the letter. The witness should
also state the reason why the person revoking the AMD could not do so
himself.
