Divorce
-------

A divorce is the legal procedure that ends a marriage.

**Judge-led approach**

The current adversarial system used in divorce proceedings is inimical
to family cases as it increases rather than resolves the conflict given
the high emotional investment. A Judge-led approach will be used in
future, where Judges are empowered to take a proactive role in court
proceedings.

This approach will place a much greater emphasis on addressing the
interests of children in a divorce. This includes:

1.  Expanding the mandate of the existing Counselling and Psychological
    Services of the State Courts;
2.  Appointing Child Representatives. This could take the form of a
    lawyer appointed to be the child’s advocate or a social worker or
    medical expert if one is required; and
3.  Enlisting the assistance of social and psychological service
    professionals to protect the best interests of the child.

**Divorce Support Specialist Agencies**

The Ministry of Law is in the midst of facilitating the development and
growth of four Divorce Support Specialist Agencies. They will provide
services such as information, non-legal advice, case management by
social workers, counselling and family dispute management. Whenever
possible, the Divorce Specialist Agencies will encourage and faciliate
the resolution of problemsoutside of Court.

**Family Law Practitioner (FLP) Accreditation**

Family lawyers often require specific skill sets in addition to
masteingr the law, such as counselling, mediation and emotional conflict
resolution skills. The Ministry of Law will be developing specialist
training for family lawyers with a view to equipping them with such
skills. Lawyers who undergo this training will receive a Family Law
Practitioner (FLP) accreditation, and parties looking to hire a divorce
lawyer could consider hiring an FLP-accreditated lawyer.r

**Preliminary considerations**

Before filing for divorce, parties should consider:

1.  The possibility of reconciliation. Project HEART is a programme to
    aid couples in their efforts to salvage their marriage.
2.  Whether they require more information on what to expect when they
    embark on divorce proceedings. Parties may find it useful to read
    relevant Family Court pamphlets, or to attend a pre-filing
    information session before filing their divorce application.
3.  Whether they require the assistance of the “Court Friend” scheme,
    whch provides practical support and help to unrepresented litigants.
4.  Couples with children must undergo a pre-filing consultation
    session, unless they are able to agree on the divorce and all
    ancillary matters. The objective of the consultation session is to
    help parents understand the importance of co-parenting and the
    practical isues arising in a divorce that may have an impact on
    children.

The Family Court will practice differentiated case management for
different types of cases entering the court system.

**Parties in a Divorce Petition**

A divorce petition usually comprises 2 parties:

1.  The Plaintiff – the spouse filing the Petition.
2.  The Defendant – the other spouse.

If the Divorce is based on the factual situation of Adultery, the 3rd
party may be named in the Petition and he or she is known as the
"*Co-Defendant*".

**Brief Outline of Divorce Procedure**

1.  STAGE 1 – Interim Judgment: When a Judge of the Family Court grants
    your divorce, he or she will hand down an Interim Judgment of
    Divorce. This is the end of the first stage of your divorce
    proceedings.
2.  STAGE 2 – Ancillary Matters: The Interim Judgment does not settle
    issues about the children, property or maintenance. In legal
    language, issues about the children, property and maintenance are
    known as ‘*ancillary matters*.’ The ancillary matters are usually
    dealt with *after* the Court has granted the Interim Judgment. This
    is the second stage of divorce proceedings.
3.  STAGE 3 – Final Judgment: You must wait until the Court has dealt
    with all the ancillary matters in your divorce, or for three months,
    whichever is later, before you can apply for a Certificate of Making
    Interim Judgment Final, or Final Judgment. You can only remarry
    after you have obtained Final Judgment.

**Who can apply for a divorce?**

A party can obtain a divorce in the Family Court if the party **or**
his/her spouse:

1.  Is domiciled in Singapore at the time of commencement of divorce
    proceedings.
    a.  A Singapore Citizen shall be deemed, until the contrary is
        proved, to be domiciled in Singapore.
    b.  The requirement of domicile goes beyond mere residency, it is
        fulfilled as long as the party considers Singapore his or her
        home, and intends to reside in Singapore indefinitely.
2.  Has lived in Singapore for at least three years immediately before
    the commencement of divorce proceedings.

**Three-Year Marriage Requirement**

Parties *cannot* apply for a divorce if they have been married for less
than three years unless they apply for leave of Court (ie. obtain the
Court’s permission) to make their divorce application.

Leave of Court in this case will be given if a party proves that:

1.  He or she has suffered exceptional hardship during the marriage, or
2.  

    The other spouse has behaved with exceptional depravity, meaning that

    :   he or she has behaved unusually badly.

The party must apply for leave of Court by originating summons,
supported with a supporting affidavit explaining the grounds for your
application.

Please note that it is **rare** for the Court to approve a divorce
application for couples married for less than three years. The threshold
for exceptional hardship and/or exceptional depravity is extremely high
and cannot usually be met in cases of adultery, barring any aggravating
conditions.

**Legal Requirements for a Divorce**

A party will be granted a divorce only if a Judge of the Family Court
agrees that his/her marriage has ended.

In legal language, the Judge must find that his/her marriage has
irrevocably broken down. This is set out in section 95 of the Women’s
Charter.

To prove that his/her marriage has irrevocablybroken down, a party must
satisfy the Court that one or more of the following facts is true:

-   That the other spouse has committed *adultery*, and the party finds
    it *intolerable* to live with him or her.
-   That the other spouse has *behaved* in such a way that the party
    cannot reasonably be expected to live with him or her.
-   That the other spouse has *deserted the party for a continuous
    period of at least two years*.
-   If the other spouse *agrees to the divorce*, that the party and the
    other spouse have *lived apart for a continuous period of at least
    three years*.
-   If the other spouse *does not agree to the divorce*, that the party
    and the other spouse have *lived apart for a continuous period* of
    *at least four years*.

+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

### Divorce Proceedings at Court

Please note that contested divorces are usually much more time-consuming
and costly than uncontested divorce hearings.

**FIRST STAGE OF DIVORCE CASE**

#### **1. Starting proceedings**

To start divorce proceedings, you must file the following documents in
Court:

1.  **Writ for Divorce, Statement of Claim and Statement of
    Particulars-** The Statement of Claim must specify on which grounds
    (adultery, unreasonable behaviour, three years’ separation with
    consent or four years’ separation) you are relying on to ask the
    Court to grant you a divorce. In the Statement of Particulars, give
    details of the fact that you are relying on.
2.  **Proposed Parenting Plan if you have children below 21 -** File an
    Agreed Parenting Plan if you and your spouse (the Defendant) have
    managed to agree on the care arrangements for your children after
    the divorce.
3.  **Proposed Matrimonial Property Plan -**If there is a Housing and
    Development Board (HDB) flat to be divided between you and the
    Defendant. File an Agreed Matrimonial Property Plan if you have
    managed to agree on what to do with the HDB flat after the divorce.
4.  **Acknowledgment of Service**
5.  **Memorandum of Appearance**

You will need to pay the appropriate filing fee.

#### **2. Service**

If your documents are in order, the Family Registry will accept your
documents for filing. Copies of your documents with the Court seal on
them (the sealed copies) will be returned to you.

Rule 11 of the Matrimonial Proceedings Rules states that the sealed
copies must then be served on the Defendant. This is to alert him or her
that you have started divorce proceedings in Court.

You must serve the sealed copies in one of the following ways:

1.  By personal service, which means that the documents must be handed
    to the Defendant directly by someone authorized to do so, such as a
    court process server;
2.  By registered post to the Defendant’s address, but only if the
    Defendant signs and returns the Acknowledgment of Service to you;
3.  By the Integrated Electronic Litigation System (eLitigation) on the
    Defendant’s lawyer, if he or she has one, but only if the
    Defendant’s lawyer indicates on the documents that he or she accepts
    service on behalf of the Defendant.

#### **3. Your first court date**

If the Defendant and yourself have agreed on a divorce, and if the
Defendant has no dispute over what you have said in your Statement of
Claim and Statement of Particulars, you must inform the Court that you
are ready for your case to be heard by ‘setting down’ your case for
hearing on an uncontested basis. You must do this by filing a Request
for Setting Down Action for Trial.

If you do not set down within six weeks of filing your Writ for Divorce,
the Court will call both parties for a Status Conference to check on
your case. You will be notified by letter if you are required to attend
Court for a Status Conference.

A Status Conference is conducted by a Deputy Registrar of the Family
Court in chambers - meaning that the hearing is closed to the public,
and only those directly involved in the matter can attend. You or the
Defendant do not have to attend a Status Conference yourself if you have
a lawyer to represent you.

At the Status Conference, the Deputy Registrar will check if all the
necessary documents have been filed in Court. If the Defendant is
contesting the divorce, the Deputy Registrar may refer the case for
counselling with a professional Court counsellor, or for a resolution
conference at the Family Relations Chambers. Further information on
Status Conferences may be found at paragraph 101 of the Practice
Directions.

If you are a Defendant, and have been served with a set of divorce
papers that you do not understand, please note that if you choose to
ignore the divorce papers, the Plaintiff is allowed to ask the Court for
a divorce hearing date by filing the Request for Setting Down Action for
Trial.

The Court may proceed to fix a divorce hearing date, hear the case, and
grant the divorce in your absence.

#### **4. Divorce hearing**

The Court will send you a letter to notify you of your next court date
once you have filed your Request for Setting Down Action for Trial.

**If your divorce is uncontested, your next court date will be the
uncontested divorce hearing date.**

Uncontested divorce hearings are normally held in Family Court 6. The
uncontested divorce hearing will be quite short, usually lasting only
five to ten minutes. A District Judge of the Family Court will hear the
case in open court, meaning that members of the public may sit in the
public gallery to watch the proceedings if they wish. The Judge may hear
up to 30 divorce cases in a single morning or afternoon.

**If your divorce is contested, your next court date will be a Pre-Trial
Conference date.**

A Pre-Trial Conference is conducted by a Deputy Registrar of the Family
Court in chambers - meaning that the hearing is closed to the public,
and only those directly involved in the matter can attend. You or the
Defendant do not have to attend a Pre-Trial Conference yourself if you
have a lawyer.

The purpose of a Pre-Trial Conference is to get both parties ready for
the contested divorce hearing, which will take the form of a trial in
open court. If there is a possibility of settlement, the Deputy
Registrar may refer the case for counselling with a professional Court
counsellor, or for a resolution conference at the Family Relations
Chambers.

If settlement is not possible, the Deputy Registrar will ask both
parties to file Affidavits of Evidence in Chief. If you are not sure
what to say, or need help preparing your affidavit, you should seek
independent legal advice immediately.

Further information on Pre-Trial Conferences may be found at paragraph
90 of the Practice Directions.

#### **5. Interim Judgment**

At the end of both types of divorce hearing, the Judge will grant an
Interim Judgment if he or she is satisfied that the marriage has
irrevocably broken down. Any ancillary matters will be adjourned to be
heard in chambers.

The Interim Judgment is a provisional order for divorce. It is made
final, or confirmed, after three months. You cannot remarry until the
Interim Judgment has been made final.

**SECOND STAGE OF DIVORCE CASE**

#### **6. Ancillary matters pre-trial process**

The second stage begins when an Ancillary Matters Pre-Trial Conference
is called. This is usually called within a month of the Interim Judgment
being granted. The Court will send you a letter to notify you of the
Ancillary Matters Pre-Trial Conference date.

An Ancillary Matters Pre-Trial Conference is conducted by a Deputy
Registrar of the Family Court in chambers - meaning that the hearing is
closed to the public, and only those directly involved in the matter can
attend. You or the Defendant do not have to attend the Ancillary Matters
Pre-Trial Conference yourself if either of you have a lawyer.

The purpose of an Ancillary Matters Pre-Trial Conference is to get both
parties ready for the ancillary matters hearing, which will take place
before a District Judge of the Family Court in chambers. If there is a
possibility of settlement, the Deputy Registrar may refer the case for
counselling with a professional Court counsellor, or for a resolution
conference at the Family Relations Chambers. In a high conflict case
where children are involved, the Deputy Registrar may consider referring
the matter to a professional Court counsellor or social worker, so that
a confidential report on custody or access may be prepared for the
purpose of the ancillary matters hearing.

If settlement is not possible, the Deputy Registrar will ask both
parties to file Affidavits of Assets and Means (Form 27). If you are not
sure what to say, or need help preparing Form 35, you should seek
independent legal advice immediately.

Further information on Ancillary Matters Pre-Trial Conferences may be
found at paragraph 90 of the Practice Directions.

#### **7. Ancillary matters hearing**

If both parties manage to reach an agreement on the ancillary matters,
the Court will give directions for a consent ancillary matters hearing
to be fixed. You must prepare a Draft Consent Order in the correct form.
Both parties must sign the Draft Consent Order. If a party has a lawyer,
it is enough for the lawyer to sign it. If a party does not have a
lawyer, he or she must sign the Draft Consent Order himself before a
Commissioner for Oaths or a lawyer.

If there is no agreement, the Deputy Registrar will fix your case for a
contested ancillary matters hearing.

Please note that if either party declares that the gross value of the
matrimonial property to be divided between you is S\$1.5 million or
more, your case must be transferred to the High Court for the contested
ancillary matters hearing.

You would make such a declaration when the Deputy Registrar asks you to
complete the Declaration of the Value of Matrimonial Assets (Form 19B).
The Deputy Registrar will normally ask both parties to complete Form 19B
at an Ancillary Matters Pre-Trial Conference.

#### **8. Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final**

Three months after the Court has granted an Interim Judgment, you may
proceed to apply for the *Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final*.

This will confirm your divorce, and conclude all Court proceedings.

### Muslim Marriages

**Can the Family Court grant a divorce to a Muslim couple, or to a
couple married under the Muslim law?**

No. The Family Court only grants divorces to couples who are married
under civil law.

Marital disputes involving Muslim parties or persons who are married
under the Muslim law come under the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court
under the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA).

A party cannot apply for a divorce in the Family Court if that party and
his/her spouse are Muslims, or were married under the Muslim law.

**Can I enforce orders made by the Syariah Court in the Family Court?**

Yes. You may choose to file a Magistrate’s Complaint for breach of the
order under sections 51 or 52 of the Administration of Muslim Law Act,
or to have the Syariah Court order registered as a judgment of a
District Court under section 53 of the Administration of Muslim Law Act.

*Commonly Asked Questions on Divorce*

**Can I proceed with the divorce if I am unable to locate my spouse?**

Yes. You may still proceed with your divorce application in the Family
Court, but the procedure may be more expensive and complicated because
the Court will still require you to serve the divorce papers on him or
her.

**Can I oppose a Writ for Divorce filed by my spouse?**

If you want to oppose your spouse’s divorce application, it is very
important that you follow the proper procedures. If you simply ignore
the Court case, the Court may decide the case without you. You may find
that your marriage has been legally ended, and that certain orders have
been made on the children, property and maintenance. These orders will
still be binding on you even if you were not at the Court hearing.

You must be clear as to whether you want to remain married to your
spouse, or if you simply want the Court to hear you on the issues
relating to the children, property and maintenance. These are the
ancillary matters and will be covered in the next section.

If you wish to remain married to your spouse, you must defend the
divorce.

You must do this by filing a Memorandum of Appearance and a Defence. A
copy of the Memorandum of Appearance will have been served on you
together with the divorce papers.

If you just want the Court to hear you on the ancillary matters, file
the Memorandum of Appearance indicating which issues you wish to be
heard on. After the Interim Judgment hearing is over, the Court will
call an Ancillary Matters Pre-Trial Conference.

**Is there a way for my spouse and I to come to an agreement so that we
can avoid a contested divorce?**

Yes. The Family Relations Chambers of the Family Court is dedicated to
helping you and your spouse come to an amicable arrangement on the
divorce and ancillary matters.

You can make a request for a Resolution Conference with a Judge of the
Family Relations Chambers. You can make your request through your lawyer
if you have one, or to the Deputy Registrar when you attend Court at the
Status Conference or Pre-Trial Conference stage of your divorce
proceedings.

You can also make a request for counseling at the Family and Juvenile
Justice Centre.

**Do I need a lawyer to get divorced?**

If you really want to, and if you are able to do so, you can apply for a
divorce yourself. In legal language, this is known as ‘acting in
person.’

But you will not be exempt from the legal, procedural and formal
requirements of conducting Court proceedings. For example, you must
ensure that the documents you file in Court are in the correct format,
that you have paid the correct filing fees, and that you have filed your
documents through the Electronic Filing System.

Most importantly, the Family Court cannot give you any advice on what
you should say or do. Only a qualified lawyer can give you independent
legal advice on the merits of your case.

**When can I remarry?**

You can only remarry after you have obtained Final Judgment—also known
as a *Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final (Form 26)*. You must
wait until the Court has dealt with all the ancillary matters in your
divorce, or for three months, whichever is later, before you can apply
for the Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final.

**Is it legal for me to make my spouse move out of the matrimonial
property during divorce proceedings?**

Generally, you will not be allowed to do so. However, in special
circumstances for example where that person has behaved in such a way
that you cannot reasonably be expected to live with him/her the court
might then grant such relief to you.

**Can a prenuptial agreement be enforced in Singapore?**

Prenuptial agreements are not enforceable per se. The court will
determine on a case by case basis.

**Is it possible for the length of separation required for divorce to be
shortened?**

Generally this relief isn’t available within the first three years of
marriage. There is an exception to this 3-year minimum rule where the
case is one of ‘exceptional hardship’.[^2] The factors which the court
must consider in deciding whether to grant leave would include if there
was any child of the marriage and whether there is a any reasonable
chance of reconciliation between the parties within the 3-year
period.[^3]

**Can we put forward a self-drafted agreement in respect of division of
matrimonial assets in connection with the grant of judgment of
divorce?**

Once the divorce proceedings reach the ancillary stage (ie. after a
final order for divorce has been granted by a court), any agreement
between the parties concerning the ownership and division of matrimonial
assets made in contemplation of divorce may be considered by a court
when deciding on such matters.[^4]

**What happens if one party wants a divorce and the other only wants a
separation?**

If the plaintiff spouse who has filed a writ for divorce is able to
satisfy the court that there has been a irrevocable breakdown of the
marriage based on one or more of the facts set out in Section 95(3) of
the Women’s Charter, then the court will determine whether to grant the
judgment of divorce. It is not necessary that the defendant spouse
agrees to the divorce in certaincases.

**If I get a divorce, does this affect my PR/immigration status?**

This is a matter in which can be referred to the Immigration and
Checkpoints Authority of Singapore.

**I have obtained a divorce in a foreign country. Can I apply to the
Singapore court to seek financial relief?**

You can apply to the Singapore court to seek financial relief provided
that:

1.  The divorce in the foreign country must be recognized as valid in
    Singapore under Singaporean law; and
2.  either party to the marriage was domiciled in Singapore on the date
    of application or was so domiciled on the date the divorce took
    effect in the foreign country or either party was habitually
    resident in Singapore for a continuous period of one year
    immediately before the date of application or the date in which the
    divorce took effect in the foreign country.

However, before any Singapore court can make an order granting financial
relief it must decide whether Singapore is the ‘natural forum’ for the
handling of the ancillary matters following the overseas divorce. The
courts must consider:

(a) The connection which the parties to the marriage have with
    Singapore.
(b) The connection which those parties have with the country in which
    the marriage was dissolved.
(c) The connection which those parties have with any other foreign
    country.
(d) Any financial benefit which the applicant or a child of the marriage
    has received, or is likely to receive, in consequence of the divorce
    or by virtue of any agreement or the operation of the law of a
    foreign country.
(e) In a case where an order has been made by a court of competent
    jurisdiction in a foreign country requiring the other party to the
    marriage to make any payment or transfer any property for the
    benefit of the applicant or a child of the marriage, the financial
    relief given by the order and the extent to which the order has been
    complied with or is likely to be complied with
(f) Any right which the applicant has, or has had, to apply for
    financial relief from the other party to the marriage under the law
    of any foreign country, and if the applicant has omitted to exercise
    that right, the reason for that omission.
(g) The availability in Singapore of any matrimonial asset in respect of
    which an order could be made.
(h) The extent to which any order is likely to be enforceable.
(i) The length of time which has elapsed since the date of the
    divorce[^5].

**Will the court consider the interests of my children when deciding
whether to grant my divorce?**

The court shall consider *all* the circumstances of the case, including
how the interests of any children of the marriage may be affected if the
marriage is dissolved. If it should appear to the court that in all the
circumstances it would be wrong to dissolve the marriage, the court
shall dismiss the divorce proceedings.

**What actions can I take against the mistress of my spouse?**

The person alleged to have committed adultery with the defendant can be
made a co-defendant in the action if such person is named in the
statement of claim, unless the court directs otherwise.

**Can I sue someone for bigamy? What are the consequences of bigamy?**

Bigamy in Singapore is regarded a criminal offence in Singapore. The
penalty for such offence is of imprisonment up to 7 years as well as a
fine.[^6]

Nullity
-------

Under certain circumstances, the court may find that the marriage should
be set aside. If the Court grants a decree of nullity the parties are
essentially in the position that they were before being married, eg it
is as if they have never been married, Such marriages can be divided
into two types; void and voidable. The marriage remains valid up until
being declared void. Annulment does not retrospectively terminate the
marriage at the point when it was formed.

**What are the grounds for annulling a marriage?**

*Applicable to a marriage which takes place after* **1st June 1981**

-   The marriage has not been consummated owing to the incapacity of
    either party to consummate it.
-   The marriage has not been consummated owing to the willful refusal
    of the respondent to consummate it.
-   Lack of consent; the marriage was not consensual on both parties,
    whether in consequence of duress, mistake, mental disorder or
    otherwise.
-   Mental illness rendering the person unfit for marriage
-   Respondent suffered from Communicable Venereal Disease prior to
    marriage
-   At the time of the marriage the wife respondent was pregnant by some
    person other than the petitioner.

The above list is not exhaustive. To rely on the grounds of mental
illness, lack of consent, pregnancy and venereal disease, the
proceedings must be instituted within 3 years from the date of marriage.

**Void Marriages**

If any of the following situations exist, then the marriage is
considered void at law i.e. no legal marriage has ever taken place:

1)  Either party is under the age of 18 years old and is married without
    the Minister's special permission.
2)  Spouses are closely related (such relationships are set out in the
    Women's Charter) and the Minister's permission has not been
    obtained.
3)  A marriage celebrated outside Singapore fails to comply with the law
    of that country.
4)  Either party is already married.
5)  Person who solemnized the marriage does not have the authority /
    valid license to do so.
6)  The parties are of the same sex as stated in their respective
    documents of identity.

A child of a void marriage born on or after **2nd May 1975** shall be
deemed the legitimate child of his/her parents if at the date of the
marriage, both or either parents reasonably believed that the marriage
was valid meaning he/she inherits his/her parents' assets if they die
intestate (without a will).

**What are the defences to the grant of a decree of nullity?**

The Court will not grant a decree of nullity in such voidable marriages
if the Respondent convinces the Court that:

a.  The Petitioner, knowing that he/she has grounds for nullity, gave
    the Respondent the impression that he/she would not seek such a
    decree.
b.  It would be unjust to the Respondent for the Court to grant the
    decree.

**What about the status of any child of a marriage that has been
annulled?**

Notwithstanding the annulment, as at the date of the decree, the child
shall be deemed to be their legitimate child (if the child would have
been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if it has been
dissolved by way of divorce instead of being annulled).

**How do I respond when served with a writ to nullify a marriage?**

You need to decide if you want to contest the annulment (e.g. because
the reasons provided by your spouse were false or unjustified). You will
need to provide additional evidence to counter the allegations made. In
such cases, you might want to contact a legal representative and/or
obtain legal advice.

If you do not wish to contest the case and both parties agree to the
annulment, it will take between 4-5 months to process. Both parties will
need to make a court appearance. You may wish to obtain legal
representation for this as well.

Judicial Separation

A Petitioner can opt to file for a Judicial Separation instead of a
Divorce. Alternatively, the parties can engage a lawyer to prepare a
Deed of Separation.

If either party is opposed to divorce on religious or other grounds, but
wishes to live apart from the other spouse, the Court may make a decree
of Judicial Separation. Such a decree is obtained by proving the same
facts as in a divorce petition.

You may wish to live permanently apart from your spouse by reason of one
or more of the following situations without commencing divorce
proceedings for various reasons. This is possible if you apply to the
Court for Judicial Separation:

(a) Adultery.
(b) Unreasonable behaviour.
(c) Desertion for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately
    preceding the presentation of the petition.
(d) Separation for 3 or 4 years with consent.

**What is the effect of a Judicial Separation?**

Once the decree of Judicial Separation is granted by the Court, the
Petitioner is no longer obliged to cohabit with the Respondent.

A decree of judicial separation does not legally end the marriage,thus
neither party can re-marry. However, a party would be entitled to make
similar claims as in a divorce (e.g. custody, maintenance and division
of matrimonial assets). Judicially separated spouses are not entitled to
claim on the intestacy of the other if that person dies intestate after
**1st June 1981**.

**Why should I choose Judicial Separation?**

There may be reasons that you may not want a Divorce such as on
religious or moral grounds. You may also not meet the 3 years'
restriction on petitions for divorces.

**In a Judicial Separation, can the Court deal with ancillary matters?**

Yes. The Court can deal with matters such as custody of the children,
maintenance and the division of matrimonial assets.

### Deed of Separation[^7]

You may wish to be separated from your spouse for a period of time
before you decide on a divorce. In the meantime, the parties can still
work on reconciliation.

In this case, you may sign an agreement called a Deed of Separation,
which will set out the terms and conditions governing the relationship
between you and your spouse during the period of separation. Both
parties may mutually agree on an arrangement for the custody care and
control of the children who are below the age of 21, maintenance of a
spouse and/or children and division of the matrimonial assets in the
event of a divorce.

A Deed of Separation is a private document, and not lodged with any
government departments, and the Separation Deed may be revoked at any
time with the consent of both parties.

Although the parties may have mutually agreed to the terms in the
Separation Deed, either party can still apply to have any of the terms
set aside by the Family Court (unless the Deed of Separation was
sanctioned by the Court).

The Deed of Separation is usually prepared by a lawyer and is signed in
the presence of a lawyer.

**Can I reconcile with my spouse after signing a Deed of Separation?**

Yes. You may reconcile with your spouse even after signing the Deed of
Separation

**How do I contest a Deed of Separation?**

The deed of separation is only valid if there is agreement and both
parties sign the deed. Both parties must consent to its terms in order
for it to be legally binding, so if you contest a Deed of Separation
immediately contact a lawyer for advice.

Ancillary Matters Upon Divorce
------------------------------

Ancillary matters that a court will adjudicate upon after granting the
Interim Judgment includes the following:

1.  Custody, care and control, and access to any child of the marriage
2.  Maintenance of a wife or ex-wife
3.  Maintenance of a child or children
4.  Division of matrimonial property

### Custody, Care and Control, and Access[^8]

In any hearing pertaining to the custody, care and control, or access to
a child, the court’s primary and overriding consideration will be the
welfare of that child. The court will make decisions based on what is in
the best interests of the child.

The parents’ wishes will come second to the child’s welfare and/or the
child’s wishes (if he or she is old enough to express an independent
opinion).

This section provides a summary of procedures in filing an application
for custody, care and control of or access to a child in the Family
Court. It deals with applications made under the Guardianship of Infants
Act. Custody, care, control and access issues may also be dealt with as
ancillary matters during divorce proceedings.

**Electronic filing**

Please note that all Court documents in guardianship proceedings must be
filed or sent to the Court using the Electronic Filing System (EFS). You
can file documents through the EFS at the LawNet/EFS Service Bureau.
There are two Service Bureaux in Singapore:

#### Starting proceedings

To start guardianship proceedings, you must file the following documents
in Court:

1.  Originating Summons
2.  Affidavit in support of the Originating Summons

The person filing the Originating Summons is the Plaintiff.  The person
against whom you are filing the Originating Summons is the Defendant.
Under paragraph 102 of the [Practice
Directions](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/subcourts/page.aspx?pageid=4433),
you must exhibit your Marriage Certificate to your affidavit if you are
or were married to the Defendant.

If there are [Syariah Court](http://www.syariahcourt.gov.sg) divorce
proceedings between you and the Defendant, Order 84 of the Rules of
Court requires you to file the following documents with your Originating
Summons:

1.  A Syariah Court commencement certificate; or
2.  The parties’ written consent to the commencement of proceedings in
    the Family Court, and a Syariah Court certificate of attendance.

You will need to pay the appropriate filing
[fees](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=3759) for all
documents filed in Court.

#### Service

If your documents are in order, the Family Registry will accept your
documents for filing.  Copies of your documents with the Court seal on
them (the sealed copies) will be returned to you. 

Serve the sealed copies on the defendant. This is to alert him or her
that you have started these proceedings in Court.

You must serve the sealed copies in one of the following ways:

1.  By personal service, which means that the documents must be handed
    to the Defendant directly by someone authorized to do so, such as a
    court process server; or
2.  By EFS on the Defendant’s lawyer, if he or she has one, but only if
    the Defendant’s lawyer indicates on the documents that he or she
    accepts service on behalf of the Defendant.

#### Your first Court date

Your first Court date is likely to be a Pre-Trial Conference before a
Deputy Registrar of the Family Court.  Both you and the Defendant will
be notified of the Court date by letter.

A Pre-Trial Conference is conducted in chambers – meaning that the
hearing is closed to the public, and only those directly involved in the
matter can attend.  You or the Defendant do not have to attend a
Pre-Trial Conference yourself if either of you have a lawyer. 

At the Pre-Trial Conference, the Deputy Registrar will check if all the
necessary documents have been filed in Court.  If the Defendant is
contesting your application, he or she will have to file an affidavit in
reply. 

If there is a possibility for amicable resolution, the Deputy Registrar
may refer the case for counselling with a professional Court counsellor,
or for a resolution or joint conference at the [Family Relations
Chambers](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=3657). 

In a high conflict case, the Deputy Registrar may consider referring the
matter to a professional Court counsellor or social worker, so that a
confidential report may be prepared for the purpose of the Originating
Summons hearing.

Further information on Pre-Trial Conferences may be found at paragraphs
89 and 102 of the [Practice
Directions](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/subcourts/page.aspx?pageid=4433).

#### Originating Summons Hearing

If an amicable resolution of your dispute is reached after attendance at
counselling, or after a resolution or joint conference, a consent order
may be recorded before a District Judge in chambers. This formally ends
the Court proceedings.

If an amicable resolution is not possible, the Originating Summons will
proceed for hearing before a District Judge in chambers.  The District
Judge will make his or her decision based on the affidavits that have
been filed in Court.  It is not necessary for you or the Defendant to
give oral evidence before the District Judge. 

After hearing both sides, the District Judge will rule on your
application, and make the necessary orders.  This formally ends the
Court proceedings. 

#### Appeals

If you are not satisfied with the District Judge’s order, you may appeal
to a Judge of the High Court.

If you wish to appeal, you must do so by filing a Notice of Appeal (Form
113) in the Civil Registry of the State Courts.  The Notice must be
issued within 14 days of the District Judge’s order.  You must then
serve the Notice on the other party within 7 days of it being issued. 
You may wish to refer to Order 55C of the Rules of Court for further
details.

The courts’ primary consideration in awarding ‘**custody**’, i.e. the
right to make major decisions about the welfare and upbringing, and the
'**care and control**' of a child (i.e. the right to have the child live
with a particular parent and to make day-to-day decisions concerning the
child), is still “the welfare of the child”.

When the Court considers the welfare of the child, some relevant factors
would be:

-   The role each parent has played in the child’s life.
-   The stability that each parent can offer the child.
-   Whether the child’s existing care arrangements can be left as they
    are.
-   The child’s age: care and control of a very young child will
    normally lie with the mother.
-   Whether there are siblings: as far as possible, the Court tries not
    to separate siblings.
-   The child’s wishes, if he or she is old enough to express an
    independent opinion.
-   The parents’ wishes: but it is important to note that this factor
    comes second to the welfare of the child.
-   

    It is now the trend for Singapore to award joint custody to both

    :   parents even though in some situations, the parents obviously do
        not get along.

-   A court order for custody may be changed later if it can be shown
    that there has been a substantial change of circumstances since the
    previous court order, and that the change would be in the best
    interests of the child.

### Commonly Asked Questions on Children’s Issues[^9]

**How does the Court decide which parent gets the children?**

The Court does not award the children to either parent. Each parent has
an equal responsibility for the children. Parental responsibility does
not change when parents’ divorce.

The Court decides two things:

> 1\. The first thing to decide is whether one or both parents should have
> custody of the children. Custody is the right to make major decisions on
> the welfare and upbringing of the children. Custody can be shared.
>
> 2\. The second thing to decide is which parent has care and control of
> the children. Care and control is the right to have the children live
> with you, and to make everyday decisions about them. For practical
> reasons, care and control normally lies with one parent.

The Court considers the welfare of the child to be the most important
factor in making its decisions on custody, care and control. The welfare
of the child is a very wide concept. It includes the child’s emotional
and physical well-being. It also includes the child’s education,
religious and moral upbringing.

**Must our children choose which parent they want to follow?**

No. If they want to, they can express their views to the Court as to
which parent they would like to live with. While the Court may consider
the children’s views against all of the circumstances of the case and
with reference to their age, it will make the decision it feels is in
the best interests of the children.

**How will I see my children if the Court grants care and control to the
other parent?**

When the Court decides on custody, care and control, the Court will make
an access order to ensure that the parent without care and control
canhis or her children regularly. When deciding on the right access
order to make, the most important factor to consider is the welfare of
the children.

If both parents can co-operate with each other, and would like to keep
the access arrangements flexible, then the Court will usually order
‘reasonable access.’ But if the circumstances of the case require the
access order to be more specific the Court may set out a timetable for
access, and any particular conditions to be complied with during access.

**What if I feel that the other parent is a bad influence on our
children, and do not want him or her to have access?**

You may ask the Court to order that the other parent does not have
access to the children, but you should be aware that access is only
denied if it will harm the children more than it will benefit them.

One option may be to ask for an order for supervised access. This means
that access will be granted to the other parent on the condition that
you, or a neutral third party such as a relative, are present. A
short-term supervised access order may also be made under the Family
Court’s Project Contact, run in conjunction with participating Family
Service Centres across Singapore. This may be suitable if your children
are very young, and the other parent is not able to handle the children
on his or her own, or if there are some concerns with his or her
interactions with the children.

**What should I do if the other parent is violent towards the
children?**

You may wish to consider applying for a personal protection order.
Please read the section on Family Violence before making such an
application.

**What should I do if the other parent suddenly takes our children out
of Singapore?**

The Women’s Charter says that once a Court order on the children is
made, it is a criminal offence to take the children out of Singapore for
more than a month without the written consent of both parents, and/or
the Court’s permission.

If you think there is a chance that the other parent may take the
children overseas without your permission, you can ask the Court for a
clear order that neither you nor the other parent can take the children
overseas without the permission of the other parent or the Court. The
Court may also order that the children’s passports be kept by you while
they are with the other parent.

You must be able to tell the Court why you want these orders to be made.
The Court will decide whether it is in the best interests of the
children to make such orders. The Court will consider if it is likely
that the other parent would take the children overseas without your
permission. Some relevant factors would be:

• Which country the other parent is likely to take the children to.

• Whether he or she is a citizen of that country.

• Whether he or she has a job or family overseas.

**How exactly do I enforce my rights to access? What do I do if the
other parent denies me access?**

When a parenting order is made, each person affected by the order must
comply with the order. If the non-custodial parent encounters problems
with access, he can file an application to request an assisted transfer
or to specify venue of handover, or commence committal proceedings. This
can be done at the Family Court at Paterson Road. Counselling and
mediation services are also available there. You must be able to prove
the allegations by providing evidence (e.g. witnesses) of contravention.

If your ex-spouse threatens to take your child out of Singapore without
your consent, you may apply to the Court for an order to prevent him
from doing so. If he/she disobeys the court order, he/she may be guilty
of contempt and may be fined or imprisoned.

**How exactly does joint custody work?**

Custody refers to the legal decision-making authority in a child’s life.
This includes, but is not limited to religion, education, and health
issues. In most cases, joint custody is granted to both parents. Both
parents have a share in making major decisions involving the child and
must agree on the decisions made. In the absence of agreement, either
parent must apply to the courts for a determination of the disputed
issue. Alternatively, and preferably, they can seek counseling or
mediation instead.

**What does ‘liberal access’ actually entail?**

“Liberal access” entails that the non-custodial parent should have
frequent contact and reasonable access to his/her child. The custodial
parent should not unreasonably prohibit such contact/access. As opposed
to fixed access arrangements, it does not entail specific
schedules/arrangements for access and is mainly characterized by the
presumption that both parties will act reasonably. What is ‘reasonable’
depends on the particular context. If either parent acts unreasonably in
withholding or being over-intrusive in accessing the child, he/she may
be guilty of contempt of court.

**What is involved in a transfer of custody?**

In general, judges avoid moving children unnecessarily as instability
may be detrimental to a child’s welfare. However, in special
circumstances, the non-custodial parent can make an application to the
family court to vary custody orders (e.g. unreasonable behavior from the
custodial parent, change in financial circumstances etc.) He/she must
furnish the court with evidence to back up the reasons provided. The
eventual decision over whether or not a transfer of custody will be
granted depends on what the judge thinks is best for the child’s
welfare.

**Do I have any rights to custody over my grandchildren?**

No, unless the courts have expressly awarded you this right.

In circumstances of divorce, under Part X of the Women’s Charter the
court is empowered to make orders as it thinks fit with respect to the
welfare of any child of the marriage. Section 125, under Part X of the
Women’s Charter, provides that the court may place the child in the
custody of the parents or a relative of the child or any other person.
Since the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration, the court
is not restricted to only awarding custody to the parents. It is
possible that a grandparent could seek custody.

 

If it is possible for a grandparent to intervene during the parents’
divorce proceedings to seek an order of custody of the child, it is
likely that access, being a ‘lesser right’ than custody, may also be
sought. A grandparent under these limited circumstances is not starting
a new application to bring the child before the court for resolution of
matters. The court is already possessed of jurisdiction and power to
make orders for the child’s welfare.

**Do I still have legal custody over my adult offspring?**

No.

The Women’s Charter defines a child as one who is under 21 years of age.
However, you may still have custody over your children in certain
special circumstances (eg. mental/physical disabilities) even if they
are 21 years and older.

**Does a child have a legal right to see his siblings?**

Your child does not have a legal right to see his siblings per se, but
it is a very compelling factor that judges will take into account in
making or varying access/custody orders.

**Will my job/profession affect my chances of gaining custody?**

Yes. Custody refers to the legal decision-making authority in a child’s
life. This includes, but is not limited to religion, education, and
health issues.. While the Court will primarily consider the child’s
well-being and moral welfare, other factors such as his physical
wellbeing and security, his ties of affection and his preferences will
be taken into account. Custody will be granted based on which parent
will be better able to provide for the child’s needs.

**What other factors may be relevant?**

A parties criminal record, admission of family violence, previous
divorce and/or children or a divorce based on ‘unreasonable behaviour’
are all factors that could affect the custody judgment.

**Can I prevent my child from living with my ex-spouse’s new partner?**

If your ex-spouse can provide a more suitable environment for your child
to live in, you cannot contravene court orders regardless of a new
partner

**How do I obtain access to my child once my social pass expires**

You can apply for a short-term social visit pass, or if you are female
with a child below 21 studying in Singapore, possibly a long-term
visitor pass. The Social Visit Pass is valid between two to four weeks
and may be subsequently renewed for up to three months. Holders of the
Social Visit Pass are not allowed to work in Singapore. For more details
on application, please visit [www.ica.gov.sg](http://www.ica.gov.sg).

**What happens if neither parent wants custody?**

The Judge may feel it is more appropriate to give the custody and/or the
care and control/access of the child to a relative or a children's
welfare organisation.

**What regulations govern custody over an illegitimate child?**

There are no fixed rules with regards to granting custody, even
involving unmarried parents. When deciding who to give the custody
and/or the care and control/access of your child to, the Judge may
consider your wishes and those of the child’s father and the wishes of
your child. In order for the child’s father to have a right to claim
custody over the child, he must be legally registered as the child’s
biological father.

With regards to a child’s right to maintenance, the Women’s Charter does
not draw any distinction based on the marital status of his/her parents.
Both parents have an obligation to maintain the child.

**What constitutes grounds for removal of visitation rights?**

If the non-custodial parent behaves in a manner that is deemed to be
detrimental to the child’s welfare (for example by flouting access
arrangements, neglecting or abusing your child), you may file for a
variation of access arrangements at the Family Court at Paterson Road.
You must furnish the courts with evidence to support your grounds for
removing visitation rights.

**Does a foreign court ruling on custody apply in Singapore?**

For cross jurisdictional marriages ending in divorce, the parents may
obtain mirror orders in that he/she obtains a similar order, or
registers the order obtained in Singapore, in another jurisdiction which
is relevant to parties. For example, if a mother from a foreign country
is given an order for custody of the children by the Singapore court,
with the Singaporean father being given access orders, either party may
apply to the foreign court for similar orders or register the Singapore
orders in that foreign country, as appropriate.

However even with a prior foreign custody order, the court, , may be
willing to re-open a custody dispute and determine the case on its
merits. While due respect will be given to a foreign order and followed
unless there are exceptional circumstances, they will not necessarily be
regarded as binding given the paramount consideration for the child’s
welfare

**Does my ex-spouse have a right to access my child’s birth certificate
if I have sole custody?**

It depends on the extent of access your ex-spouse has to your child,
which is determined by the court. The Judge may, in this specific
circumstance, choose to interview the parties involved or obtain a
welfare report by various governmental agencies to determine whether he
or she should have access to your child’s birth certificate. The court
will order a welfare report if it is of the view that the input of
someone trained and experienced in child welfare would be useful in
coming to a decision on what orders to make in relation to the custody
and/or access dispute between parties. 

Reports may be ordered by the deputy registrar at the ancillary
pre-trial conference, the court mediator or the judge hearing the
ancillary matters.[^10]

### Starting proceedings

You must come **personally** to the Family Court to complete the
standard Magistrate’s Complaint form.  You may do this at the Family
Registry, Level 1, Family and Juvenile Court Building.

You must bring:

1.  Your Marriage Certificate, if any
2.  Your children’s Birth Certificates, if you are applying for their
    maintenance
3.  A copy of the Court order that you wish to enforce, if you are
    applying for enforcement

As you are the person filing the Magistrate’s Complaint, you are the
Complainant. The person against whom the Magistrate’s Complaint is made
is the Respondent.

When you have completed and submitted your Magistrate’s Complaint, you
will be taken before a Magistrate or District Judge to have it sworn or
affirmed, eg confirming that the contents of what you have written in
the form are true and correct. .  It is a serious offence to include
statements that you know to be untrue or incorrect in a sworn or
affirmed Magistrate’s Complaint.

If your application is in order, the Magistrate or District Judge will
direct that a summons to the Respondent be issued. 

You will have to pay the
prescribed[fee](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=3759)
for the issuance of the summons.

The Family Registry will set a date for the personal service of the
summons on the Respondent.  The Respondent will be sent a letter at the
address you have provided, to inform him or her that he or she has to
attend at the Family Court for the service of the summons.

### Service appointment

If both you and the Respondent are present, personal service of the
summons will be effected on the Respondent.  If both of you are in
agreement , you will be referred for a free mediation service with a
Court mediator to see if you can reach a settlement on the maintenance
issue.  If a settlement is reached, you will both be brought before a
Magistrate or District Judge to have the settlement recorded as a Court
order.  That will conclude your case.  You will both receive copies of
the order by post.

If the Respondent is absent from Court on this date, you will have to
accompany the Court process server to the Respondent’s address if you
wish to proceed with your application.  You will have to pay the
prescribed
[fee](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=3759) for
service of your summons by the Court process server.

Once the summons has been served on the Respondent, a date will be set
for the mention of your case in Family Court 1. 

If you fail to turn up on any of your Court dates, including the date
for service of the summons on the Respondent, your application may be
struck out.  This means that you will have to file another Magistrate’s
Complaint, and pay the fee again.

If you are the Respondent, your failure to turn up will result in the
issuance of a Warrant of Arrest against you.

### Your first Court date

Your first Court date will be a mention of your case in Family Court 1
before a District Judge.  A mention is a short hearing.  It usually
lasts only five minutes.  A District Judge may hear up to 30 or 40
mentions per half-day session in Family Court 1.

At your mention, the Judge will:

-   Consider whether the case may be resolved by agreement.
-   Give orders on the production of evidence—in maintenance cases, the
    usual evidence consists of parties’ bank and CPF statements, salary
    slips, IRAS Notices of Assessments and lists of personal monthly
    expenses.
-   Give orders on the filing of affidavits, if you or the Respondent
    have lawyers, or know how to prepare affidavits.
-   Determine how many days are needed for the hearing of your case, and
    fix trial dates accordingly.

If you have applied to enforce an existing maintenance order, the
District Judge may direct the Respondent to show cause as to why he or
she has breached the maintenance order, and why enforcement action
should not be taken against him or her. 

If you are the Respondent, you should ensure that all the documents you
want to rely on—for example, any medical reports or letters of
retrenchment—are ready to be shown to the Judge on the mention date.

### Hearing in open court

If you are not able to settle the maintenance dispute with the
Respondent, you will each have to give evidence before a Magistrate or
District Judge to prove your respective cases.  This will be done in a
trial in open court.  If either party wishes to call witnesses at the
trial, they should inform the District Judge of their intention during
the mention in Family Court 1.

The trial may last anything from an hour or two, to a few days,
depending on the complexity of your case. The District Judge in Family
Court 1 will assess this, and decide how much time to allocate to your
case.

At the trial, the proceedings will generally take the following
structure:

-   The Complainant gives his or her documents to the Court, and takes
    the witness stand to give sworn or affirmed evidence.
-   The Respondent may cross-examine the Complainant on what he or she
    has said.
-   The Respondent gives his or her documents to the Court, and takes
    the witness stand to give sworn or affirmed evidence.
-   The Complainant may cross-examine the Respondent on what he or she
    has said.

If either party is represented, the trial will be conducted by their
lawyers. At the end of the hearing, the lawyers will present arguments
on behalf of each party.

The Magistrate or District Judge will then make the necessary orders. 
This concludes your case.

### Appeals

If you are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a Judge of
the High Court.

If you wish to appeal, you must do so by filing a[Notice of Appeal (Form
114)](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=8541) in the
[Civil Registry](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/civil/index.aspx) of the
State Courts.  The Notice must be filed and served within 14 days of the
order. You must also provide security for the other party’s costs of the
appeal in the sum of \$2,000, if you are appealing against a
Magistrate’s order, or \$3,000, if you are appealing against a District
Judge’s order.  You may wish to refer to Order 55D of the Rules of Court
for further details. **Please note that court staff cannot help you with
your appeal papers.  **

### Respondents residing outside Singapore

If you want to file a Magistrate’s Complaint against a respondent who
resides outside Singapore, you may do so if:

-   You know the respondent’s address in the foreign country.
-   The country is one of those which has made arrangements with
    Singapore on maintenance matters.

These countries are listed in the Maintenance Orders (Facilities for
Enforcement) Act (Cap 168) and the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal
Enforcement) Act (Cap 169).

If you meet these conditions, you may file a Magistrate’s Complaint in
the same way that you would if the respondent lived in Singapore. 

If you are applying to **enforce** an existing maintenance order, you
must bring a copy of that order when you come to the Family Court to
file your Magistrate’s Complaint.  After your Complaint is filed, the
Court will send the necessary papers to the authorities in the
respondent’s country for enforcement. 

If you are applying for maintenance **for the first time**, you will be
given a Court date to attend before a Magistrate or District Judge in
open court.  You must bring:

-   Your Marriage Certificate, or the children’s Birth Certificates, if
    you are applying for their maintenance.
-   Information on the respondent’s residential address in the foreign
    country.
-   A photograph of the respondent.

You will give sworn or affirmed evidence, and produce any documents in
support of the application – such as, for example receipts for expenses
incurred by the child, if you are applying for maintenance of a child. 

The Magistrate or District Judge may then issue a provisional
maintenance order.  The provisional maintenance order will be sent to
the respondent’s country. The provisional maintenance order must be
confirmed before it becomes effective. 

The procedures in each receiving country will vary depending on what
mechanisms or practices have been put in place by the competent
authorities in that particular country.  Family Court staff will not be
able to advise you on how long the process will take in the receiving
country.

### Commonly Asked Questions on Maintenance

**Who can apply for maintenance?**

Any married woman whose husband neglects or refuses to provide her
reasonable maintenance may apply to a District Court or a Magistrate’s
Court and that Court may, on due proof thereof, order the husband to pay
a monthly allowance or a lump sum for her maintenance.[^12]

Additionally, the following persons may also apply for an order to grant
maintenance from either the District Court or a Magistrate’s Court,
namely:

(a) Any person who is a guardian or has the actual custody of the child.
(b) Where the child has attained the age of 21 years, by the child
    himself.
(c) Where the child is below the age of 21 years, any of his siblings
    who has attained the age of 21 years, or
(d) Any person appointed by the Minister[^13].

**Do I have to maintain my child if the Court has granted care and
control to the other parent?**

Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall
be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of
his or her children.[^14]

**What factors does the Court consider in making a maintenance order?**

Below are the following factors which the court will take into
consideration in deciding whether to make an order for maintenance or
not, namely:

(a) the financial needs of the wife or child;
(b) the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial
    resources of the wife or child;
(c) any physical or mental disability of the wife or child;
(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the
    marriage;
(e) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the
    welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking
    after the home or caring for the family;
(f) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or child before the
    husband or parentneglected or refused to provide reasonable
    maintenance for the wife or child;
(g) in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in
    which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or
    trained; and
(h) the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct
    is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to
    disregard it.[^15]

**Can I withhold access if the other parent has not been paying child
maintenance?**

No. The Court considers maintenance issues and parenting issues
separately. You are still bound by the Court order to allow the other
parent to have access to the children even if he or she is not making
regular maintenance payments. You similarly can’t withhold maintenance
payments if the other parent has denied you access to your child[^16].

However, where a parent is failing to make maintenance payment/s an
applicant can apply to court to enforce the maintenance order. In this
situation the court may order any of the following, namely:

(a) For every breach of the order by warrant direct the amount due to be
    levied in the manner by law provided for levying fines imposed by a
    Magistrate’s Court.
(b) Sentence him to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month for
    each month’s allowance remaining unpaid.
(c) Make a garnishee order in accordance with the rules made under this
    Act.
(d) Order the person to furnish security against any future default in
    maintenance payments by means of a bankerʼs guarantee.
(e) If the court considers it in the interests of the parties in the
    maintenance proceedings or their children to do so, order the person
    to undergo financial counselling or such other similar or related
    programme as the court may direct.
(f) Make a community service order requiring the person to perform any
    unpaid community service for up to 40 hours under the supervision of
    a community service officer[^17].

**How do I represent myself in Court without a lawyer?**

If you represent yourself in court without a lawyer’s assistance, you
are said to be operating pro se (“for oneself”). The procedures you must
follow are the same as those of lawyers, except that you yourself will
be responsible for filing and filling out legal forms (e.g. calculations
of maintenance needs, collation of evidence).

You can do this online at eLitigation, Singapore’s electronic legal
filing database, which can be accessed with your Singpass. It offers
lawyers and court users a single access point for commencement and
active management of case files throughout the litigation process. The
system also provides functionalities and related services that
streamline the litigation process, thereby helping to improve efficiency
and enhance access to justice.[^18]

**Do I have to pay maintenance if my spouse did not mention this in the
Writ of Divorce?**

For a child’s maintenance, the judge can order you to pay for the child
at any time either before or after a final judgment for divorce has been
granted.[^19] This maintenance order may subsequently be further varied
subject to changing circumstances (e.g. needs of the child, finances of
either parent).[^20]

For spousal maintenance, however, your spouse will need to apply for
maintenance during divorce proceedings themselves, although this does
not necessarily restrict itself to the stage of serving you with the
writ of divorce. A divorce suit takes place in 2 stages. In the 1^st^
stage, the courts will decide if the marriage will be dissolved.
Ancillary matters such as those relating to spousal maintenance will be
dealt with at the second stage.[^21]

In cases where a maintenance order is urgently required, an application
can be made immediately at the State Courts without having to wait for
the divorce hearing in the High Court. The application can be made
anytime during the marriage or separation or after the divorce.[^22]

**What mode of payment should I use to pay maintenance (Cheque? Bank
transfer?)**

You should check with your ex-spouse and work out a suitable agreement
between the both of you. The method you eventually choose should enable
you to meet your maintenance responsibilities in a timely and consistent
fashion. Such details would be included in the maintenance order handed
down from the Judge.[^23]

**Is it possible to pay maintenance solely to my child and not to my
ex-spouse?**

If your child is under 21, it is unlikely that the court will allow
maintenance payments to be paid directly to him/her. If your child is
legally an adult, you may seek a variation of your child maintenance
orders (e.g. to pay schooling fees directly to your child).

If your minor child's needs are not being met and you are worried about
their welfare (e.g. that the money is being misused), you may apply to
the Family Court for a variation of maintenance orders.[^24]

**Will the fact that I have outstanding loans/debt affect the amount of
maintenance I have to pay?**

The judge will consider the earning and financial capacity of both
parties in deciding the amount of maintenance to be paid.[^25] However,
maintenance orders may be varied in the future subject to changing
circumstances (e.g. repayment of debts, change of job).[^26]

**Can I defer maintenance payments until I finish my studies and get a
job?**

Before granting an order of maintenance, a Judge would consider all
necessary factors, such as age, occupation and financial capacity of the
parties.[^27] The order of maintenance when effective would mean that
the party would be obliged to make the payments immediately.

**Do I still have to pay child maintenance if my ex-spouse passes away
and our child lives with my ex-spouse’s relatives?**

It is the individual responsibility of each parent to maintain and
contribute to the maintenance of his/her children.[^28] Therefore, even
where one of the parents passes away, the obligation to maintain the
child will still rest with the parent which is still alive.

Additionally, for example, where a maintenance order was previously
granted which stated that the parent had to make payments to the other
parent of the child, who has since passed away; a fresh application for
maintenance could be made by any of the following persons for the child,
namely:

(a) any person who is a guardian or has the actual custody of the child;
(b) where the child has attained the age of 21 years, by the child
    himself;
(c) where the child is below the age of 21 years, any of his siblings
    who has attained the age of 21 years; or
(d) any person appointed by the Minister.[^29]

**How can I prove that I have been paying maintenance?**

A court has the power to make an attachment of earnings order in
connection with the payment of maintenance.[^30] This will require the
employer to directly pay the wife/child a specified sum out of the
earnings of his/her employee. In such cases, it would be important for
the employer to keep a record of such payments being made.

In other situations, for example, if a person ordered to pay maintenance
is self-employed, he/she should keep personal receipts and records of
any payments which have been made.

**What would be a reasonable amount of maintenance to request?**

What would be considered a reasonable amount of maintenance differs from
case to case depending on the outcome of the court based upon its
investigation of the factors of each party.[^31]

**Can I request a lump maintenance sum?**

A court, when granting a maintenance order, may either require a person
to make periodical payments or a lump sum payment, which may be required
to be secured.[^32]

**Can I nominate a third party’s bank account for my maintenance to be
paid into?**

When the court makes a maintenance order it will usually specify:

-   The full amount of the maintenance to be paid and how much is to be
    paid for the spouse/civil partner and how much for each child
-   The frequency of payments – weekly, fortnightly or monthly
-   The date on which the first payment is to be made
-   To whom payments are to be made
-   Method of payment

If there are special circumstances verifiable by evidence, you may
request that maintenance be paid into a third party’s bank account in
the court order for maintenance. Alternatively, if this is not specified
by the court, you should check with your ex-spouse if he would agree to
such an arrangement and subsequently confirm the agreement in written
form to provide evidence of such a variation.

**Can I claim maintenance from an ex-boyfriend?**

Only a married woman can claim maintenance from her husband. However, if
the ex-boyfriend is the parent to your child then an application can be
made for maintenance of the child.[^33]

**Can I claim maintenance from a partner who is in jail?**

Yes. As stated above, in deciding on the exact amount of maintenance to
be paid a judge would take various factors into accounts, such as, the
financial capacity of the individuals.[^34]

**Can I compel my ex-spouse to pay maintenance in advance if he is about
to emigrate?**

Such a matter would likely be considered by a court when you present
your evidence.

**How do I obtain a court record of arrears in maintenance?**

A record of arrears in maintenance can only be provided by yourself. The
Family Court can however, enforce a recovery of arrears for up to 3
years of maintenance before the filing of the enforcement application,
if evidence of any arrears you furnish is adequate. Note that any
arrears in excess of 3 years cannot be recovered unless the Court, under
special circumstances, otherwise allows.[^35]

**Can my ex-spouse remarry if he owes me outstanding maintenance
payments?**

Yes. However, if the ex-spouse at any time refuses or neglects to make
payments as provided under the maintenance order, the aggrieved party
may seek the assistance of a court to initiate enforcement proceedings
of the maintenance order.[^36]

**Will I able to gain sole custody of our child if my ex-spouse fails to
meet his maintenance obligations?**

No.

The Court considers maintenance issues and parenting issues separately.
You are still bound by the Court order to allow the other parent to have
access to the children even if he or she is not making regular
maintenance payments. You may wish to apply to Court to enforce the
maintenance order against the other parent. The Court can impose a fine
or jail term if your ex-spouse is persistently in arrears of
maintenance.[^37]

**Can I enforce a maintenance order made overseas?**

There is a list of countries provided under Singapore law, whose orders
for maintenance can be enforced in a Singapore court.[^38] Countries
included in the list are:

(a) The United Kingdom;
(b) New Zealand;
(c) Hong Kong;
(d) China;
(e) Province of Manitoba, and;
(f) Australia.

**Can maintenance be claimed for education fees?**

Yes.

The general rule is the maintenance is not required to be paid once a
child has reached the age of 21. However, a court may order for
maintenance payments to continue to be paid after the child has reached
21 where the child is or will be receiving an education.[^39]

**As a child, how do I file a maintenance claim?**

Where the child is below the age of 21, the following persons are
eligible to make an application for an order of maintenance on his/her
behalf, namely:

> Any person who is a guardian or has the actual custody of the child:

(a) Where the child has attained the age of 21 years, by the child
    himself
(b) Where the child is below the age of 21 years, any of his siblings
    who has attained the age of 21 years, or
(c) Any person appointed by the Minister[^40]

### Proceedings For Division of Matrimonial Property

#### Starting proceedings

To start proceedings for the division of matrimonial property, you must
file the following documents in Court:

-   Originating Summons
-   Affidavit in support of the Originating Summons

The person filing the Originating Summons is the Plaintiff. The person
against whom you are filing the Originating Summons is the Defendant.

You may refer to the Affidavits Fact Sheet for more information on how
to prepare and file an affidavit. However, if you are not sure what to
say, or need help preparing your affidavit, you should seek independent
legal advice immediately.

If you are making your application under s 17A(2)(c) of the Supreme
Court of Judicature Act, you must also file the following documents with
your Originating Summons:

-   A Syariah Court commencement certificate; or
-   The parties’ written consent to the commencement of proceedings in
    the Family Court, and a Syariah Court certificate of attendance; and
-   If there is an HDB matrimonial asset to be divided, an [Agreed or
    Proposed Matrimonial Property
    Plan](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=3764).

You will need to pay the appropriate [filing
fees](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=3759) for all
documents filed in Court.

#### Service

| If your documents are in order, the Family Registry will accept your
  documents for filing. Copies of your documents with the Court seal on
  them (the sealed copies) will be returned to you.
| Serve the sealed copies on the defendant. This is to alert him or her
  that you have started these proceedings in Court.

You must serve the sealed copies in one of the following ways:

-   By personal service, which means that the documents must be handed
    to the Defendant directly by someone authorized to do so, such as a
    court process server
-   By EFS on the Defendant’s lawyer, if he or she has one, but only if
    the Defendant’s lawyer indicates on the documents that he or she
    accepts service on behalf of the Defendant

#### Your first Court date

Your first Court date is likely to be a Pre-Trial Conference before a
Deputy Registrar of the Family Court. Both you and the Defendant will be
notified of the Court date by letter.

A Pre-Trial Conference is conducted in chambers—meaning that the hearing
is closed to the public, and only those directly involved in the matter
can attend. You or the Defendant do not have to attend a Pre-Trial
Conference if both of you have a lawyer.

At the Pre-Trial Conference, the Deputy Registrar will check if all the
necessary documents have been filed in Court. If the Defendant is
contesting your application, he or she will have to file an affidavit in
reply.

If there is a possibility for amicable resolution, the Deputy Registrar
may refer the case for a resolution conference at the [Family Relations
Chambers](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=3657).

Further information on Pre-Trial Conferences may be found at paragraphs
89 and 111 of the Practice Directions.

#### Originating Summons hearing

| If an amicable resolution of your dispute is reached after a
  resolution, a consent order may be recorded before a District Judge in
  chambers. This formally ends the Court proceedings.
| If amicable resolution is not possible, the Originating Summons will
  proceed for hearing before a District Judge in chambers. The District
  Judge will make his or her decision on the affidavits that have been
  filed in Court. It is not necessary for you or the Defendant to give
  oral evidence before the District Judge.

After hearing both sides, the District Judge will rule on your
application, and make the necessary orders. This formally ends the Court
proceedings.

#### Appeals

| If you are not satisfied with the District Judge’s order, you may
  appeal to a Judge of the High Court.
| If you wish to appeal, you must do so by filing a Notice of Appeal) in
  the Civil Registry of the State Courts. The Notice must be issued
  within 14 days of the District Judge’s order. You must then serve the
  Notice on the other party within 7 days of it being issued. You may
  wish to refer to Order 55C of the Rules of Court for further details.

### Commonly Asked Questions on Division of Matrimonial Property

**Can I keep our HDB flat after the divorce?**

That depends. If the HDB flat is a matrimonial asset, the Court can make
an order for division of this matrimonial asset.[^42]

It is very important that you check with HDB that you are eligible to
retain the flat.[^43] You must do this before the ancillary matters
hearing, because the Court will not be able to give you an answer to
this question.

It is also very important that you check on your own financial status to
see if you can reimburse the CPF money that your spouse used to buy the
flat, and to pay any cash amount that your spouse may ask for in return
for the transfer. You may need to make some inquiries with your bank.
Again, you must do this before the ancillary matters hearing, because
the Court will not be able to help you with financing the transfer.[^44]

**If my spouse and I have reached an agreement to sell our (HDB) flat
after the divorce, must we refund the CPF money we used to buy the flat
to our CPF accounts?**

You will both need to refund the money used for the purchase of your
home, with interest on those amounts, or such amounts as to be
determined by the CPF Board, to your respective CPF accounts.[^45]

You should refer to the CPF Board website for current information on CPF
rules, regulations and policies.[^46]

**How does the Court decide on our shares of the matrimonial assets?**

In making an order for the division of matrimonial assets, the Court
will consider all circumstances of the case including the following
factors:

(a) The extent of the contributions made by each party in money,
    property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the
    matrimonial assets.
(b) Any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party
    for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the
    marriage.
(c) The needs of the children (if any) of the marriage.
(d) The extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of
    the family, including looking after the home or caring for the
    family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party.
(e) Any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and
    division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce.
(f) Any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one
    party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party.
(g) The giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party
    (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of
    assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on
    of his or her occupation or business.
(h) To the extent relevant, such matters which are considered when the
    Court determines the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man
    to his wife or former wife as set out in section 114(1) of the
    Women’s Charter of Singapore[^47].

**What is a matrimonial asset?**

A matrimonial asset is deemed to be an asset acquired by either party
before the marriage which was used by both parties or their children for
shelter, transportation, household, educational, recreational, social,
aesthetic purposes or was an asset which was substantially improved upon
in the marriage by either parties to the marriage.

A matrimonial asset also includes an asset of any nature acquired during
the marriage by either party or both parties to the marriage.

However, a matrimonial asset shall not include any asset which was
acquired by a party to the marriage by way of gift or inheritance (apart
from the matrimonial home) and that has not been substantially improved
during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the
marriage.[^48]

**What if one or both of us is bankrupt?**

When a person is made bankrupt, the Official Assignee will step in to
manage all his assets except for the HDB flat[^49] and CPF money.[^50]

The Court will still divide the matrimonial assets in the same way as in
a case where neither spouse is bankrupt. But the Official Assignee may
attend the ancillary matters hearing to make representations on behalf
of the bankrupt spouse. If you and your spouse have reached an agreement
on the division of the matrimonial assets, you will need to obtain the
Official Assignee’s approval before the Court will endorse your
agreement.

For more information on bankruptcy and the role of the Official
Assignee, you may wish to refer to the website of the Insolvency and
Public Trustee’s Office.[^51]

**What happens if my spouse has debts/liabilities? Will that affect the
division of matrimonial assets/property?**

In deciding on the division of matrimonial assets, the Court will take
into consideration various factors including any debt owing or
obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint
benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage.[^52]

Therefore, in cases where the debts/liabilities of your spouse are
contracted for the joint benefit for both of you, then it will affect
the division of matrimonial assets.

Except in such cases, you will not be liable for your spouse’s
individual debts/liabilities.

**If I transfer my flat as a gift to a family member, will it still be
considered as a matrimonial property?**

No. If the property is validly transferred to a third party as a gift,
such property will no longer constitute matrimonial asset.

However, in deciding on the division of matrimonial assets, the Court
will take into consideration various factors including the extent of the
contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family.[^53]
Therefore, if you transfer your flat as a gift to a family member, then
it may affect the division of matrimonial assets.

**Are there any actions I can take to prevent the sale of the
matrimonial property?**

The Court may make an order postponing the sale or vesting of any share
in any matrimonial asset, or any part of such share, until such future
date or until the occurrence of such future event or until the
fulfilment of such condition as may be specified in the order.[^54]

Regarding the ownership of matrimonial property, the Court will apply
general principles of property law to your dispute – in other words, the
Court will decide your dispute according to the same principles that
apply in property disputes between people who are not married to each
other.[^55]

**What happens if the matrimonial property still has an outstanding
mortgage?**

In deciding on the division of matrimonial assets, the Court will take
into consideration various factors including any debt owing or
obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint
benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage.[^56]

Therefore, in case where the matrimonial property still has an
outstanding mortgage, such amount will be taken into account when the
court divides the matrimonial assets.

**Is it legal for my ex-spouse to withdraw and withhold all the money
from our joint account?**

It is legal for your ex-spouse to withdraw and withhold all the money
from the joint account, as long as such action does not conflict with a
court order or an agreement between you and your ex-spouse.

In a joint-alternate account, each of the account holders may perform
banking transactions on that account individually. Therefore, one of the
holder may withdraw money, write cheques or close the account without
consulting the joint holder.

However, even if it is legal to withdraw money, any asset acquired
during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage will
constitute matrimonial asset.[^57] Therefore, the money withdrawn from
the joint account should, in general, constitute matrimonial asset and
be subject to the court’s decision on division of matrimonial assets.

**How can I regain possessions taken by my ex-spouse?**

The Court may make an Order vesting any matrimonial asset or any part
thereof in either party.[^58] Therefore, if the possessions constitute
matrimonial assets, you may apply to obtain a Court Order vesting the
possessions in you to regain such assets.

**What happens if I ignore a Court Order?**

If you ignore a Court Order, the Judgment Creditor (opponent) may
enforce the Order against you. An Order for the payment of money can be
enforced by either Writ of Seizure and Sale or Garnishee
proceedings.[^59]

Garnishee proceedings take place where a judgment debtor is owed money
from a third party.[^60]

**What happens if my ex-spouse wants to sell the matrimonial property
and I do not?**

If you wish to keep the matrimonial property, you may adjust the
division of matrimonial assets by requesting the Court to make an order
to vest the matrimonial asset in you or in a third party to be held on
trust. If it is better to divide the matrimonial asset, the court may
make an order vesting any matrimonial asset owned by both parties
jointly in both the parties in common in such shares as the court
considers just and equitable.[^61]

**Can I reclaim a personal loan I made to my ex-spouse after our
divorce?**

As long as the personal loan agreement meets the requirement of the law
of contract, such agreement is valid.[^62] If the loan is payable, then
you may reclaim the loan.

**Am I eligible to purchase a HDB flat while I am separated?**

Depends on the conditions. According to the website of HDB, requirements
regarding family nucleus of a HDB purchaser are as follows:

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Scheme**         | **Family Nucleus**                              |
+====================+=================================================+
| Public             | You, the applicant, and; • Your spouse, and     |
|                    | children (if any) • Your parents, and siblings  |
|                    | (if any) • Your children under your legal       |
|                    | custody, care and control (for widowed/         |
|                    | divorced)                                       |

|                    |                                                 |
|                    | | must be First-timers and are:                 |
|                    | | • Unmarried , divorced or widowed[^63]        |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Please note that during separation, although you will still be treated
as married under the law, some HDB schemes will treat separated people
as “single” provided that you have the legal documents.

**Is there a time limit within which matrimonial assets have to be
divided?**

There is no time limit regarding the application for division of
matrimonial assets. However, a judge may decide on a “cut-off date” for
determining matrimonial assets depending on the circumstances. In other
words, instead of taking a view such as “until the final judgment is
made, the “marriage” still exists in law and any assets acquired by any
party until then should be regarded as matrimonial assets”, the judge
may set the “cut-off date” before the final judgment.

Further, if you wish to appeal against the District Judge’s order, you
must do so by filing a [Notice of
Appeal](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/family/page.aspx?pageid=8577#M_N) in
the Civil Registry of the [State
Courts](http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/civil/index.aspx) within 14 days of
the District Judge’s order.

**What happens if a joint-owner of the matrimonial property is a third
party?**

The share of property owned by that third party must be calculated and
exempted when dividing the matrimonial asset.

In general, issues regarding ownership of third party will be discussed
during Ancillary Matters Pre-Trial Conference (‘APTC’). APTC is held in
divorce cases where an Interim Judgment has already been granted, in
order for the court to give the appropriate directions to resolve the
ancillary matters in as expeditious a manner as possible. For example,
issues that will be discussed include: Are there any matrimonial assets
or alleged matrimonial assets which are in the name of a third party, or
over which a third party may have a claim? What is the worth of this
matrimonial asset? Can all parties agree on what share the third party
has in the matrimonial asset? And has the third party been served with
the relevant documents in these proceedings?

**How do I remove my ex-spouse’s name as an occupier of the HDB flat?**

You may delete the names of the existing occupiers from the flat, if the
occupiers are no longer staying in the flat.

**(1) Eligibility Criteria:** You can delete the names of existing
occupiers, provided that the deletion of occupiers does not make you
ineligible to retain the flat under an eligibility scheme. For example,
deletion of the name of an occupier may mean that there is no longer a
family nucleus; therefore, the flat owner cannot retain the flat under
the eligibility scheme.

**(2) Application Procedure:** If you wish to delete the names of
existing flat occupiers, you can submit your application, (a) online,
through My HDBPage; HDB Branch will process the application and inform
the flat owners of the outcome; or (b) if you do not have Internet
access at home, you may visit HDB Branch, where you can submit your
application via the Internet Personal Computer at the public waiting
area.

If you are not familiar with the Internet Personal Computer and need
assistance, Customer Service Officers will assist you.[^64]

HDB-related issues upon Divorce[^65]
------------------------------------

### Policies - Retention of Flat Ownership

After taking possession of an HDB flat, the family structure may change.
As such, existing flat owner(s) can apply to retain the flat subject to
the HDB eligibility conditions. The common changes to the family
structures are:

(a) Annulment of Marriage / Break-up of Fiancé & Fiancée Relationship
(b) Divorce
(c) Separation

\(d) Others: Demise of Joint Owner; Demise of Sole Owner /
Tenant-in-Common; Loss of Citizenship; Married Child Moving Out

#### Annulment of Marriage / Breakup of Fiancé & Fiancée Scheme

If a divorce is due to the non-consummation of marriage, annulment of
marriage, or there is a break-up of the Fiancé / Fiancée relationship,
neither party is allowed to retain the HDB flat. Retention of the flat
by either party is only allowed with parents who were originally listed
in the application to buy the HDB flat. If none of the owners is
eligible to retain the flat, the owners may have to return the flat to
HDB at the prevailing compensation price, subject to HDB's approval.

HDB flat owners who are seeking an annulment of marriage should request
his / her private solicitor handling the divorce or annulment to submit
either an "Agreed Matrimonial Property" Plan or "Standard Query" Form to
the HDB Branch Office managing the matrimonial flat for an assessment of
his / her eligibility to retain the flat.

#### Divorce

Under the HDB's prevailing policy for divorce (not due to
non-consummation of marriage or annulment or break-up of Fiancé /
Fiancée relationship), a divorced party who has the custody of the child
(including care and control) is allowed to retain the flat subject to
the eligibility conditions.

If there are no children from the marriage, the divorced party may also
retain the flat alone under the Single Singapore Citizen (SSC) Scheme
if:

(a) He / she is a Singapore citizen
(b) He/she is least 35 years old and above

    \(c) The matrimonial flat must be a resale flat purchased from the open
    market without the CPF Housing Grant for Family

If the matrimonial flat is bought directly from HDB (including resale
flats bought with the CPF Housing Grant for Family), the 5-year minimum
occupation period (MOP) must be satisfied before the divorced party is
allowed to take over the flat under the SSC Scheme.

Alternatively, the divorced party may include another person to retain
the flat, subject to the prevailing eligibility criteria and eligibility
scheme regardless of the occupation period.

#### Resale of Matrimonial Flat

If the divorced owners wish to resell their flat in the open market,
they must have completed the MOP for the matrimonial flat as at the date
of divorce. If the divorce is within the MOP and none of the owners is
eligible to retain the flat, the owners may have to return the flat to
HDB, subject to HDB's approval. The compensation for the return of flat
will be determined by HDB.

##### **Eligibility to sell a HDB Flat (if it is the Matrimonial Flat)**

HDB policies that all sellers should be aware of regarding their
"eligibility to sell":

-   Ethnic Group Policy: the ethnic group of your buyer have not reached
    the prescribed limits under the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP)
-   If the resale flat is purchased by a Singapore Permanent Resident
    (SPR) family, the family must meet the SPR quota (the SPR proportion
    in the block or neighbourhood) *in addition to* the EIP

HDB flat owners must have physically occupied their flats for a period
of time, referred to as MOP, before they are eligible to sell it on the
open market. Flat owners can request for a written confirmation by
submitting an on-line request form

The MOP is calculated from the date the owner collects the keys to the
flat. It excudes any period that the flat is not occupied by flat
owners, such as when the whole flat is rented out or when there is any
infringement of the flat lease.

The length of MOP depends on the purchase mode, the flat type and the
date of the flat application:

+--------------------------------+----------------------+-------------+

+--------------------------------+----------------------+-------------+

Flat owners may submit an e-Request on Confirmation on the Computation
of Requisite Occupation Period for the purpose of resale.

##### **Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP)**

Flat owners must ensure your buyers meet the EIP.

The EIP is to promote racial integration and harmony and to prevent the
formation of racial enclaves, by ensuring a balanced ethnic mix among
the various ethnic communities living in public housing estates.

The EIP is applicable to the purchase of new flats, resale flats, SERS
(Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme) replacement flats and DBSS
(Design, Build & Sell Scheme) flats as well as the allocation of rental
flats in all HDB estates.

*Under the Policy:*

-   Maximum proportions are set for all ethnic groups: Chinese, Malays
    and Indian/Others, in each HDB block and neighbourhood. There is no
    restriction on the sale and purchase of an HDB flat if the
    proportion of the buyer's ethnic group is within the prescribed
    block and neighbourhood limits.
-   Once the block/neighbourhood limit for a particular ethnic group has
    been reached, no further sale of HDB flats to that ethnic group will
    be allowed.
-   There is no restriction if the buyer and seller are of the same
    ethnic group.

##### **Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) Quota**

The SPR quota ensures that SPR families can integrate into the local
community for social cohesion and to prevent enclaves from forming in
the public housing estates. SPR families buying a resale flat have to
meet the SPR quota (the SPR proportion in the block or neighbourhood).
This is ascertained in addition to the EIP.

The quota will only apply to non-Malaysian SPR households. Malaysians
are not included because of close historical and cultural links to
Singapore.

A non-Malaysian SPR household is one with no Singapore Citizen or
Malaysian-SPR buyers, ie. where all flat buyers are non-Malaysian SPRs.
A non-Malaysian SPR household buyer must satisfy both the ethnic
proportion limit and SPR Quota to qualify to buy a resale HDB flat.

##### **Checklist for Buyers/Sellers:**

You may check the eligibility of buyer's ethnic group and SPR Quota
eligibility in any particular block using the following channels:

1.  e-Service in HDB InfoWEB: Enquiry on Ethnic Group Eligibility
2.  HDB Home-Link (24 hours): 1800-8663060
3.  Sale/Resale Customer Service Line (office hours): 1800-8663066

The status of changes of ethnic proportions is updated on the first day
of every month and is applicable for resale applications submitted to
HDB in the current month.

CPF-related issues upon Divorce[^66]
------------------------------------

**What happens to my CPF when I divorce?**

If you have used your CPF savings to purchase your property, a charge is
created to ensure that a refund is made to your CPF account when you
dispose of your property. Note that you will need to refund the
principal CPF amount withdrawn for the property, including the accrued
interest, to your CPF account when you sell or transfer the property.
Otherwise, the charge on the property remains and you will not be able
to complete the transaction.

If you are 55 years old and above when you sell your property, the CPF
refunds will be used to top up your Retirement Account up to your cohort
Minimum Sum and your Medisave Account up to the current Medisave Minimum
Sum. Any excess housing refunds will be paid to you within 5 working
days from the date the refund is credited to your CPF account.

### Disposal of Matrimonial Property and CPF Refunds

**If the Matrimonial Home is an HDB Flat**

Upon your divorce, you can choose to dispose of your flat in the
following ways:

1.  Transfer your share to your ex-spouse
2.  Sell your share to your ex-spouse
3.  Sell your flat on the open market

You will first need to check with HDB if you are eligible to transfer or
sell your flat. This can be carried out on the HDB website.

In the case of a sale (to your ex-spouse or on the open market), you do
not need to make a full CPF refund if the selling price is not enough
for you to do so. This is provided the flat is sold at or above market
value.

Since 1 October 2007, the Court has been given greater flexibility to
order the transfer of the property to the ex-spouse with no or a partial
CPF refund. When the property is subsequently sold, the CPF amount not
refunded at the time of transfer and the amount withdrawn by the
ex-spouse for the flat, including accrued interest, would have to be
refunded to the ex-spouse’s CPF Account.

**Conditions for transfer with partial or no CPF refund**

a)  The ex-spouse must be a Singaporean or Singapore Permanent Resident.

b\) Loans or grants taken by the member which are repayable or refundable
to the Government must be repaid or refunded first before the transfer
can take place. Grants include housing grants from HDB and HOPE (Home
Ownership Plus Education) grants from the Ministry of Social and Family
Development (MSF).

**Rules for CPF Refund**

Upon sale of the transferred property, the ex-spouse will be required to
refund the member’s principal CPF used, plus the accrued interest,
computed at the point of transfer to the ex-spouse, that was not
refunded, plus his/her own principal CPF used plus the accrued interest,
regardless of the ex-spouse’s age.

If the ex-spouse is 55 years old and above, the CPF refunds will be used
to top up his/her Retirement Account up to his/her cohort Minimum Sum
and Medisave Account up to the current Medisave Minimum Sum. Any balance
housing refunds will be paid to him/her thereafter.

**If the Matrimonial Home is Private Property**

Upon your divorce, you can choose to:

1.  Transfer your share to your ex-spouse.
2.  Sell your share to your ex-spouse.
3.  Sell the property on the open market.
4.  Retain your respective shares in the property.

In the case of a sale (to your ex-spouse or on the open market), you do
not need to make a full CPF refund if the selling price is not enough
for you to do so. This is provided the property is sold at fair market
value.

More details on the amount to be refunded if you sell your share of your
property to your ex-spouse, or if you and your ex-spouse are selling the
property on the open market can be found on the CPF website.

### *Distribution of CPF Savings In Matrimonial Proceedings*[^67]

**Can a member transfer his/her share in the property to his/her
ex-spouse?**

Prior 1 October 2007, a member could only transfer his/her share in the
matrimonial property to the ex-spouse after the required CPF refund had
been returned. In instances where the member or ex-spouse did not have
sufficient funds to effect the required CPF refund, the transfer of the
property could take place.

The CPF laws were changed on 1 October 2007 to give the Court the
flexibility to order the transfer of the member’s share in the property
to the ex-spouse with no or partial CPF refund. The CPF not refunded at
the time of transfer will be treated as having been withdrawn by the
ex-spouse, who will then be required to make the necessary refund to her
own account when she subsequently sells the property.

**Can you show me an example of the CPF transfer?**

**Example:**

> 1\. The Court has ordered the member transfers to his share of the
> property to the ex-spouse without any CPF refund to member’s account.
>
> 2\. The member is below 55 and had used \$100,000 from his CPF savings,
> inclusive of accrued interest. The ex-spouse had used \$20,000 from her
> CPF savings, inclusive of accrued interest.

**A) At the point of transfer of the member’s share of the property to
the ex-spouse:** The member transfers his share of the property to the
ex-spouse without the need for any refunds to be made to his CPF
account(s).

**B) At the point of ex-spouse relinquishing her interest in the
property:** The ex-spouse refunds her CPF principal amount used and the
member's portion of CPF monies withdrawn including interest to her CPF
Account. (\$100,000 plus \$20,000 plus accrued interest. Interest on
\$100,000 and \$20,000 will be accruing from the time of transfer to
time of sale.)

**What are the member’s obligations after the Court Order is issued,
before and following the transfer?**

The member has to take the necessary steps and execute the necessary
legal documents to transfer his/her share in the property to his/her
ex-spouse. Upon the transfer of the property, the member has to refund
the sum as ordered by the court.

Also, loans or grants taken by the member which are repayable or
refundable to the Government must be repaid or refunded first before the
transfer can take place. Grants include housing grants from HDB and HOPE
(Home Ownership Plus Education) from MFS.

**What are the ex-spouse’s obligations following the transfer?**

If the court so orders, the ex-spouse has to refund the sum (amount
decided by the court) to the member’s CPF account upon transfer. The
court may also order no refunds to the member upon transfer.

Upon the eventual disposal of the flat, the ex-spouse would be required
to refund his/hers and the member's portion of CPF monies withdrawn
including interest to his/her own CPF Account.

**RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES**

**I’ve got my Court Order. What do I do next?**

Either your lawyers or yourself (if you are acting in person) are
advised to serve the Court Order on the CPF Board. All Court Orders
relating to matrimonial proceedings which involve actions to be taken by
CPF Board are to be served personally at the Retirement Schemes
Department, Applications Section at 79 Robinson Road CPF Building
Singapore 068897.

**My divorce is settled and an order on division of matrimonial assets
was granted before 1 October 2007. Can I send the order to CPF Board?
Can I vary the order to benefit from the new CPF laws?**

Yes, you can send the order to CPF Board. CPF Board would effect the
order as directed but it would follow the law before 1 October 2007.

You may apply to the court to vary the order but it is up to the court
to decide if existing Court Orders can be amended to benefit from the
new CPF rules. Please seek your own legal advice on this.

**After the transfer has been done, I reached a different agreement with
my ex-spouse. Can we undo the transfer?**

The CPF Board has no power under CPF laws to reverse the transfer after
the CPF Board has affected the Court Order which directs such a
transfer. Please seek your own legal advice on this.

**Can the courts order the sale of the member’s share of the matrimonial
property to the ex-spouse without any CPF refund?**

No.

Upon sale of the member’s share of the matrimonial property to the
ex-spouse, the required CPF refund has to be first returned to the
member’s CPF Account. The court can then order the transfer of the
refunded CPF monies from the member’s CPF Account to the ex-spouse’s CPF
Account if it so wishes.

### Distribution of CPF Investment Scheme (Cpfis) Investments In Matrimonial Proceedings

**I am required to give some of my CPFIS investments to my ex-spouse as
specified in the Court Order. What should I do after receiving the Court
Order?**

If the Court Order involves the division of your CPF assets, you or the
lawyer representing you should serve the Court Order personally on CPF
Board at the Retirement Schemes Department, Applications Section at 79
Robinson Road CPF Building Singapore 068897

You should also proceed to execute the transfer/liquidation of your
investments in accordance with the Court Order. Please refer to the CPF
website (<http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/>) for a step-by-step guide on how a
transfer/sale of CPFIS investments is effected from you to your
ex-spouse.

**What are the options available to my ex-spouse in the division of my
CPFIS investments as part of the divorce proceedings?**

If your ex-spouse is a CPF member who is a Singaporean or Permanent
Resident (PR), he/she can request the Court to make an order for CPF
Transfer or Charging Order.

**CPF Transfer**

A CPF transfer involves the Court ordering:

i)  An immediate transfer of your investments to your ex-spouse; or

    > ii\) Your investments to be liquidated and the sale proceeds to be
    > transferred to your ex-spouse.

**Charging Order**

The Court can order a charge to be placed on your investment sale
proceeds. This entitles your ex-spouse to withdraw the sale proceeds in
cash only when you turn 55 years old or when you are entitled to
withdraw your CPF savings earlier on other grounds after you have set
aside the CPF Minimum Sum and Medisave Minimum Sum applicable to you.

If your ex-spouse is a foreigner (ie. not a Singaporean or a PR), he/she
can only request the Court to make a Charging Order. Your ex-spouse will
be able to withdraw the sales proceeds in cash when you turn 55 years
old or when you are entitled to withdraw your CPF monies earlier on
other grounds. You will not need to set aside the CPF Minimum Sum and
Medisave Minimum Sum applicable to you for your ex-spouse to get his/her
entitlement. This is a concession to foreign ex-spouses to ensure
equitable treatment as they do not have immediate access to their
entitlement until you turn 55 years old.

**What are the criteria to be fulfilled by my ex-spouse before my
investments could be transferred to him/her? What are the options
available to my ex-spouse who could not fulfill the criteria?**

Before your investments could be transferred to your ex-spouse, he/she
must be a CPF member who is Singaporean or a PR and 21 years old and
above. If your ex-spouse is below 21 years old, he/she could consider
requesting the Court to order your investments to be liquidated and the
sale proceeds to be transferred to his/her CPF accounts.

**What are the obligations that my ex-spouse assumes when my investments
are transferred to him or her?**

When your investments are transferred to your ex-spouse, he/she will be
subjected to the CPFIS rules (e.g. investments are subject to stock/gold
limits, types of investments CPF savings could be used) so as to ensure
his/her own retirement adequacy.

If your ex-spouse sells the transferred investments, the sale proceeds
will be credited to his/her Ordinary and/or Special Accounts, where
applicable. The amount will be subject to CPF rules and can only be
withdrawn when he/she meets the withdrawal conditions under Section 15
of the CPF Act.

Your ex-spouse will have to pay bank charges for the transferred
investments that he/she continues to hold in his/her Investment Account.
Such charges can be paid using his/her Ordinary Account savings.

**Why do I have to effect the transfer/sale of investments? What happens
if I do not come forward to effect the transfer/sale of investments?**

You are solely responsible for presenting the Court Order and/or
completing the necessary forms at the relevant financial intermediaries
to effect the transfer/sale of investments because the financial
intermediaries require authorisation and instruction from the owner,
i.e. you.

If you do not sign the transfer form, your ex-spouse may apply to the
Court for the Registrar of Court to sign the transfer form on your
behalf. Your ex-spouse will need to furnish the required information
(eg, Divorce Petition number, both of your names, contact numbers, CPF
account numbers, Investment Account numbers, names of agent banks, name
of your investments, name of financial intermediaries, etc) to complete
the transfer form.

If you do not sell the investments as ordered, and the investments are
such that they cannot be sold without instruction being given personally
by you (as required by the financial intermediaries), your ex-spouse may
request for the Court Order to be varied to transfer your investments to
him/her instead. As this depends on the nature of the investments, your
ex-spouse should make the necessary enquiries with the financial
intermediaries concerned before obtaining the appropriate order.

**Who should bear the costs incurred for such transfer/sale? Can CPF
savings be used to pay such costs?**

You bear all costs unless otherwise stated in the Court Order. You may
use cash, CPF savings or sale proceeds to pay agent banks and product
providers to process the transfer or sale.

**Which investments can be transferred? Which investments have to be
liquidated for proceeds to be transferred? Which financial
intermediaries to approach for transfer/liquidation of investments?**

Please refer to the step-by-step guide on the CPF website for more
details (<http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/>).

**Can the cash balance in my Investment Account be transferred?**

Yes, cash balances in your Investment Account can be transferred but you
have to initiate the transfer of cash balance from your Investment
Account to your Ordinary Account first before CPF Board can transfer the
balance to your ex-spouse’s Ordinary Account.

**What happens if I pass away before the order is effected?**

Your Estate will effect the transfer or sale of investments on your
behalf as set out in the Court Order. Your ex-spouse is advised to
consult his/her lawyer on how to complete the transfer. Such matrimonial
assets belonging to your ex-spouse under the Court Order will not be
subject to estate duty payable by your Estate.
