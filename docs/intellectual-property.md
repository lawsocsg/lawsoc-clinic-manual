INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
=====================

Introduction
------------

**World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)**

The WIPO was established in 1967. It was tasked to promote the
protection of intellectual property throughout the world through
co-operation among the Governments of Contracting States of the Paris
Convention 1883 and the Berne Convention 1886. WIPO’s mission is to lead
the development of a balanced and effective international intellectual
property system\* that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit
of all.

There are 187 current Member States, including Singapore. WIPO's
strategic direction, budget and activities are determined by its Member
States, who meet in the Assemblies, Committees and other decision-making
bodies.

Definitions of the various forms of intellectual property
---------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations by individuals for which
exclusive rights are given. A creative musical, artistic or dramatic
piece; a new inventory innovation; a symbol of a business which has been
recognised through the hard work and toil gone into it: these are
examples of what define intellectual property.

The various forms of IP protection in Singapore are copyright, trade
mark, passing off, registered design, trade secret and confidential
information, patent, geographical indication, layout-design of an
integrated circuit, as well as plant variety.

**Copyright**

Copyright is the exclusive and assignable *legal right of an author* of,
among other things, dramatic, musical, artistic or literary works. It
protects works like novels, computer programs, plays, sheet music and
paintings. It also protects works like sound recordings, cinematograph
films, television and sound broadcasts and cable programmes. These
rights enable a copyright owner to control the commercial exploitation
of his work.

**Trade Mark**

A trade mark indicates *trade origin*. It is any sign capable of being
represented and of distinguishing one’s goods or services dealt with or
provided in the course of trade from those of others.

**Passing off**

A passing off action involves a *deception* made by a person to sell his
own goods under the pretence that they are the goods of another. Such
unfair business practice affects the goodwill of another.

**Registered Design**

A design means *features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament*
applied to or embodied in an article by any industrial process. It is
the appearance of articles we see everyday. An article refers to any
object to which the design is applied.

**Trade Secret and Confidential Information**

The law on trade secrets is closely tied with the law on confidential
information. A trade secret or confidential information is some
*undisclosed information* or "secret" that is important to a business or
company and is kept out of the public domain. This category of IP offers
protection of extremely valuable business assets. It is a term commonly
used to cover information that has commercial value.

**Patent**

A patent is a right granted to an *owner of an invention* that prevents
others from replicating the invention, using the invention, selling the
invention and importing or exporting the invention. In order for someone
to do any of the above the consent of the patent owner would be
required.

**Geographical Indication**

A geographical indication means any indication or sign used on goods in
trade to identify them as *originating from a specific place*. It
usually consists of the name of the place of origin of the product. Such
labels convey to the consumers that the product possesses special
qualities, reputation or characteristics that are essentially
attributable to that place of origin.

**Layout - Design of an Integrated Circuit**

This refers to the 3-dimensional disposition, however expressed, of the
elements of an integrated circuit (at least one of which is an active
element), and of some or all of the interconnections of an integrated
circuit, or such a 3-dimensional disposition prepared for an integrated
circuit intended for manufacture.

**Plant Variety**

A plant variety means a plant grouping within a single botanical taxon
of the lowest rank which, irrespective of whether the conditions for a
grant of protection are fully met, can be:

(a) Defined by the expression of the chacteristics resulting from a
    given genotype or a combination of genotypes
(b) Distinguished from any other plant grouping by the expression of at
    least one of those characteristics
(c) Considered as a unit with regard to its suitability for being
    propagated unchanged

Copyright
---------

Copyright is a form of personal or moveable property. It can be licensed
or transferred, either as an *entire bundle* (all of the distinct rights
under copyright) or as a *single, distinct right* within the copyright
bundle (e.g. only the right to reproduce).

For a work to be protected by copyright, it has to be *original* and
*expressed in a tangible form* such as in a recording or in writing.
Originality simply means that there is a degree of independent effort in
the creation of the work. It is not a question of whether the work has
creative merit.

### Works Protected By Copyright

Copyright protects literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Other
subject matter like films, sound recordings, broadcasts, cable
programmes and published works are also protected. Such rights are often
referred to as neighbouring or related rights.

Copyright protects the expression of ideas (e.g. in words and
illustrations.) Ideas alone are not protected. The following may be
protected under copyright law:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Literary works**    Written works/books, articles in journals or
  such as               newspapers, lyrics in songs, source codes of
                        computer programs
  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  **Dramatic works**    Scripts for films & drama (as applied),
  such as               choreographic scripts for shows or dance routines

  **Musical works**     Music (i.e melody)

  **Artistic works**    Paintings , drawings, sculptures, engravings,
  such as               photographs, buildings or models of buildings,
                        works of artistic craftsmanship. eg designer
                        furniture that is not mass produced

  **Published editions  Typographical arrangements of a published work
  of literary,          
  dramatic, musical or  
  artistic works**      

  **Sound recordings**  An aggregate of sounds recorded on tapes, CDs, etc

  **Films**             An aggregate of visual images and sounds recorded
                        on tapes, video compact discs, digital versatile
                        discs, etc

  **Television and      Broadcasts by way of television or radio
  radio broadcasts**    

  **Cable programmes**  Programmes (visual images and sound) included in a
                        cable programme service sent by means of a
                        telecommunication system

  **Performances**      By performer such as musicians, singers and
                        comedians
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What Is Not Protected By Copyright?

Subject matter not protected by copyright includes:

-   Ideas (e.g. a new business idea that have not been documented)
-   Concepts (e.g. an idea for a new game show that has not been written
    down)
-   Procedures (e.g. the steps involved when applying for a travel visa)
-   Methods (e.g. the unique solution to a mathematical problem),
    **and**
-   Subject matter that has not been made in a tangible form in a
    recording or writing (e.g. a speech or a dance that has not been
    written down or recorded)

**Automatic Protection**

In Singapore, an author automatically enjoys copyright protection as
soon as he creates and expresses his work in a tangible form. There is
no need to file for registration to secure copyright protection.

### Overseas Protection For Copyright Works Created In Singapore

A copyright work created by a Singapore citizen or resident is protected
in many countries overseas by virtue of international agreements.
Generallythe work of a Singapore citizen or resident would be protected
in countries which have signed the international agreements as though
the work was made there. Some countries such as Canada and the U.S.
provide for registration to facilitate proof of copyright infringement
proceedings.

-   The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
    Works is a convention on copyright protection of literary and
    artistic works including films. It is administered by the WIPO. A
    list of countries party to the Berne Convention may be found at the
    WIPO website[^1].
-   The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
    Rights (TRIPS Agreement) (1994) is an international agreement on
    intellectual property rights including copyright, patents, and trade
    marks. Ratification of TRIPS is a mandatory requirement for
    membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO). A list of member
    countries of the WTO may be found at the WTO website[^2].

### The Symbol *©*

The use of the symbol is simply a notice of a claim by the copyright
owner that copyright exists. It does not give the copyright owner any
substantive *right* and is not crucial to the enjoyment of copyright
protection.

Conversely, the non-use of the symbol does not imply a *waiver* or loss
of copyright. It may, however, be a relevant fact in infringement
proceedings. The Court will take into account whether the infringing
party had knowledge that material was protected, and may lower damages
if not. The use of the © symbol would generally stop the infringing
party from successfully relying on such an argument.

In practice, the © symbol is usually followed by the year when copies of
the work were first made available, and the name of the copyright owner,
e.g. © 2005 Intellectual Property Office of Singapore. Sometimes, near
the © symbol, there may be a statement indicating the terms of permitted
use, e.g. “for Private Use Only”. Where the owner does not allow use,
the term “All Rights Reserved” may be found after the © symbol.

### Proof Of Originality

In practice, authors have resorted to a number of means to preserve
their interests. They may have:

-   Deposited a copy of their work with their solicitors or a
    depository.
-   Sent a copy of their work to themselves by post leaving the envelope
    unopened on its return so that the date stamp and the unopened work
    could establish the date of existence and the work as it existed at
    the relevant time, **or**
-   Made a declaration stating the facts of ownership and the date of
    creation before a Commissioner of Oaths.

These are however no foolproof methods of proving authorship as none
prove that the work is original or created by the author. In a dispute,
the Court will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to prove
authorship.

In an action, it is presumed that copyright subsists in the work and
that the plaintiff is the copyright owner unless the defendant (i.e.
alleged infringer) challenges that. If the defendant challenges in good
faith whether copyright subsists in the work or whether the plaintiff is
the copyright owner, the plaintiff will have to file an affidavit with
assertions of relevant facts to show that copyright subsists and that he
is the copyright owner.

### Ownership And Rights

Generally, the person who created the work (i.e. the author) owns the
copyright in the work. However, there are exceptions to this general
rule. Some exceptions are:

**Employment**: If the work is created by an employee pursuant to the
terms of his employment, the employer owns the copyright in the work.

**Special situation for newspaper/magazine/periodical employees:**

Where an employee of a newspaper, magazine or periodical creates a
literary, dramatic or artistic work pursuant to the terms of his
employment and for the purpose of publication in a newspaper, magazine
or periodical, the proprietor of the newspaper, magazine or periodical
owns the copyright in respect of publication in or reproduction for the
purpose of publication in any newspaper, magazine or periodical. The
employee owns the remaining rights that make up the copyright bundle of
exclusive rights.

**Commissioning**: If a portrait / photograph / engraving is
commissioned by another party, the commissioner owns the copyright in
the work. If the portrait / photograph / engraving is required for a
particular purpose, this purpose must be told to the commissioned party.
While the commissioner is the copyright owner, the commissioned party
has the right to stop others from doing any act comprised in the
copyright, unless such act is done for the particular purpose for which
the portrait / photograph / engraving is created.

For other types of commissioned works, ownership belongs to the
commissioned party.

As mentioned in the introduction, the copyright owner may transfer his
rights to another party or entity either partially or wholly.

### Seeking Permission From Copyright Owners

Consent is needed to do anything that only the copyright owner has the
exclusive right to do (e.g. reproduce the work). Sometimes, consent is
indicated in the terms of permitted use, e.g. “for Private Use Only”.
Otherwise, one should seek consent. Merely acknowledging the source when
one uses the work is insufficient.

To obtain consent from copyright owners, one may:

-   Contact the copyright owners directly and negotiate for a licence to
    use the copyright work, **or**
-   Obtain a licence through a collecting society.

A collecting society is an organisation that administers the rights of a
group of copyright owners. It can grant consent for use of the works of
its members under specific conditions. The following are collecting
societies in Singapore:

-   Composers and Authors Society of Singapore
-   Copyright Licensing and Administration Society of Singapore Ltd
-   Music Publishers (Singapore) Ltd
-   Recording Industry Performance Singapore Pte Ltd
-   InnoForm Entertainment Pte Ltd
-   Motion Picture licensing Company (Singapore) Pte Ltd
-   Horizon Music Entertainment Pte Ltd

Not all IP Associations are collecting societies that administer
licences. The following are IP Associations that represent the interests
of copyright owners. Generally they are non-profit, non-government
bodies engaging in promotional, educational and trade-related activities
on behalf of their members:

-   Business Software Alliance
-   International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers
-   International Federation of the Phonographic Industry
-   Recording Industry Association (Singapore)
-   The Motion Picture Association

### Copyright Tribunals

The Copyright Tribunal is a forum for resolving certain disputes between
copyright owners and users of copyright works. The Tribunal’s
jurisdiction is set out in Part VII of the Copyright Act (Cap. 63).

The Tribunal is empowered to:

-   

    Resolve disputes relating to licences and licence schemes in relation

    :   to a work or other subject matter.

-   Ascertain the royalty payable for the recording of musical works
    and, where applicable, apportion the royalty in respect of a record.
-   Determine what constitutes "equitable remuneration " for the making
    available to the public of a sound recording through a
    non-interactive digital audio transmission.
-   Determine what constitutes "equitable remuneration" for the making
    of a recording or film of a work.
-   Determine what constitutes "equitable remuneration" for the making
    of a copy of a sound recording.

The Copyright Tribunal has the power to refer to the High Court any
matter that comes before it for determination on a point of law. This
may be done on its own volition or at the request of any party to the
matter.

Furthermore, Part X of the Copyright Act (Cap. 63) provides that the
Tribunal may determine the terms on which the government can use
copyright material.

The procedure for applications to be made to the Tribunal is set out in
the Copyright Tribunal (Procedure) Regulations 1988. The forms are
available from the IPOS website[^3].

### Copyright Infringement

Under the Copyright Act, there are two broad categories of things that
are protected by copyright. These are:

(a) “Works”, including, a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work
(b) Subject matter other than works including; sound recordings,
    cinematograph films, television broadcasts and sound broadcasts,
    cable programs and published editions of a literary, dramatic,
    musical or artistic work

**Infringement of works**

There are three categories of matters which will be deemed an
infringement of the copyright in any work. These include:

(a) Where a person, without the licence of the owner of the copyright,
    does in Singapore, or authorises the doing in Singapore of, any act
    comprised in the copyright.
(b) Where a person, without the licence of the owner of the copyright,
    imports an article into Singapore and sells, lets for hire, or by
    way of trade offering or exposing for sale or hire, the article, or
    distributes the article for the purposes of trade or for any other
    purpose to an extent that will affect prejudicially the owner of the
    copyright, or by way of trade exhibiting the article in public,
    where he knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the making of the
    article was carried out without the consent of the owner of the
    copyright
(c) Where a person who, in Singapore, and without the licence of the
    owner of the copyright, distributes an article and sells, lets for
    hire, or by way of trade offers or exposes for sale or hire the
    article, or by way of trade exhibits the article in public, where he
    knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the making of the article
    constituted an infringement of the copyright or, in the case of an
    imported article, the making of the article was carried out without
    the consent of the owner of the copyright, and that distribution of
    the article for the purpose of trade or for any other purpose to an
    extent that affects prejudicially the owner of the copyright shall
    be taken to be the sale of those articles

**Acts which are *not* an infringement of works**

**A. Fair Dealing**

Under the provisions of the Copyright Act, copying the whole or a part
of a copyright work is permissible as long as it is a 'fair dealing'.
Factors that will be taken into account in deciding whether such copying
is a fair dealing include the following:

-   The purpose and character of the dealing, including whether such
    dealing is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational
    purposes.
-   The nature of the work or adaptation.
-   The amount and substantiality of the part copied taken in relation
    to the whole work or adaptation.
-   The effect of the dealing upon the potential market for, or value
    of, the work or adaptation.
-   The possibility of obtaining the work or adaptation within a
    reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price.

Where the copying is for the specific purposes of research or study, it
shall be taken to be a fair dealing as long as the copying limits are
observed. For a published work of at least 10 pages, the copying limits
are up to 10% of the number of pages or one chapter, whichever is the
greater.

In other cases, fair dealings for the purposes of criticism, review or
reporting current events would not constitute copyright infringement. In
the case of criticism or review and the reporting of current events in a
newspaper, magazine or similar periodical, a sufficient acknowledgment
of the work is required.

**B. Other Exceptions**

It is further not an infringement to a work if a person:

-   Does anything which is the copyright owner's exclusive right to do
    if it is done for the purposes of judicial proceeding or of a report
    of a judicial proceeding, or seeking professional advice from an
    advocate and solicitor, or the giving of professional advice by an
    advocate and solicitor..
-   Makes a reproduction of a work, or of a computer program being an
    adaptation of the work, that he owns, which the reproduction is made
    by him, or on his behalf, for the purpose of using that duplicate
    copy in lieu of the original copy in the event that the original
    copy is lost, destroyed or rendered unusable
-   Decompiles a computer programme expressed in a low level language
    where it is necessary to achieve the objective of obtaining the
    information necessary to create an independent computer program
    which can be operated with the computer program decompiled or with
    another computer program and the information so obtained is not used
    for any other purpose.
-   Observes, studies or tests the functioning of a computer programme
    in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any
    element of the computer program, if he does so while performing any
    of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing
    the computer program which he is entitled to do.

**Infringement of subject matter other than works**

There are three categories of matters which will be deemed an
infringement of the copyright in any subject matter other than works.
These include:

(a) Where a person, not being the owner of the copyright, and without
    the licence of the owner of the copyright, does in Singapore, or
    authorises the doing in Singapore of, any act comprised in the
    copyright
(b) Where a person, without the licence of the owner of the copyright,
    imports an article into Singapore and sells, lets for hire, or by
    way of trade offers or exposes for sale or hire, the article, or
    distributing the article for the purposes of trade or for any other
    purpose to an extent that will affect prejudicially the owner of the
    copyright, or by way of trade exhibiting the article in public,
    where he knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the making of the
    article was carried out without the consent of the owner of the
    copyright
(c) Where a person who, in Singapore, and without the licence of the
    owner of the copyright, distributes an article and sells, lets for
    hire, or by way of trade offers or exposes for sale or hire the
    article, or by way of trade exhibits the article in public, where he
    knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the making of the article
    constituted an infringement of the copyright or, in the case of an
    imported article, the making of the article was carried out without
    the consent of the owner of the copyright, and that distribution of
    the article for the purpose of trade or for any other purpose to an
    extent that affects prejudicially the owner of the copyright shall
    be taken to be the sale of those articles

**Acts which are *not* an infringement of subject matter *other than*
works**

**A. Fair dealing**

In determining whether a fair dealing with a subject matter other than
works is established, a court would look into the following factors,
namely:

-   The purpose and character of the dealing, including whether such
    dealing is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational
    purposes
-   The nature of the audio-visual item
-   The amount and substantiality of the part copied taken in relation
    to the whole audio-visual item
-   The effect of the dealing upon the potential market for, or value
    of, the audio-visual item
-   The possibility of obtaining the audio-visual item within a
    reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price

An example of when a fair dealing may be done with a subject matter
other than a work, would be where the purpose is for research and study.

In other cases, fair dealings with an audio-visual item for the purposes
of criticism, review or reporting of news would not constitute copyright
infringement. In the case of criticism or review and the reporting of
news in a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical, a sufficient
acknowledgment of the first-mentioned audio-visual item is required.

**B. Other exceptions**

It is further not an infringement to a subject matter other than a work
if:

-   Where **50 years** or more has lapsed since the making of a sound
    recording or cinematograph film, and such sound recording or
    cinematograph film has never been published and is kept in the
    collection of a library or archives where it is, subject to any
    regulations governing that collection, accessible to the public,
    then a person may make a copy or make a communication of the sound
    recording for the purpose of research or study or with a view to
    publication.
-   Where for the purposes of preservation/replacement of the sound
    recording or cinematograph film that forms, or formed, part of the
    collection of a library or archives, making a copy is necessary to
    preserve against loss or deterioration or for the purpose of
    research or is necessary to replace because of damage,deterioration
    or has been lost or stolen.
-   Where a filming or recording is made of broadcasts or programmes for
    private and domestic use
-   Where a record is made of a sound broadcast or a cinematograph film
    of a television broadcast or of a cable programme for educational
    purposes.

### Remedies Available To Copyright Owners

Where there has been an infringement of the copyright of the owner, that
person (or an authorised person in whom the copyright priviliges have
been assigned) may take legal action in a court to obtain the following
remedies:

(a) An injunction
(b) Damages
(c) An account of profits
(d) Where the plaintiff has elected for an award of statutory damages in
    lieu of damages or an account of profits, statutory damages of:
(e) Not more than \$10,000 for each work or subject-matter in respect of
    which

    the copyright has been infringed

(f) Not more than \$200,000 in the aggregate, unless the plaintiff
    proves that

    his actual loss from such infringement exceeds \$200,000

**Factors in Determining Statutory Damages**

In determining the amount of statutory damages, the court is to consider
these factors:

-   The nature and purpose of the infringing act, including whether the
    infringing act was of a commercial nature or otherwise
-   The flagrancy of the infringement
-   Whether the defendant acted in bad faith
-   Any loss that the plaintiff has suffered or is likely to suffer by
    reason of the infringement
-   Any benefit shown to have accrued to the defendant by reason of the
    infringement
-   Conduct of both parties before and during proceedings
-   The need to deter other similar infringements
-   Any other relevant matters

Criminal Offences under Copyright Law
-------------------------------------

In Singapore, criminal offences under copyright law include the
following:

(a) Where a person makes for sale or hire, sells or lets for hire, or by
    way of trade offers or exposes for sale or hire, or by way of trade
    exhibits in public, any infringing copy of a work protected by
    copyright.
(b) Where a person imports into Singapore an article which is an
    infringing copy of a work protected by copyright for the purpose of
    selling, letting for hire, or by way of trade offering or exposing
    for sale or hire the article, distributing the article for the
    purpose of trade or for any other purpose to an extent that will
    affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright in the work, or by
    way of trade exhibiting the article in public
(c) Where a person, at a time when copyright subsists in a work
    distributes such a work for the purposes of trade or for other
    purposes but to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner
    of the copyright
(d) Where a person, at a time when copyright subsists in a work, makes
    or has in his possession an article specifically designed or adapted
    for making copies of the work
(e) Where a person for his private profit causes a literary, dramatic or
    musical work to be performed in public, or causes a cinematograph
    film to be seen or heard or seen and heard in public, other than by
    the reception of a television broadcast or cable programme

In any of the instances above, it must be proved that the infringing
party knows or ought reasonably to know that the copies are infringing
copies.

The penalties imposed for an offence committed under either parts (a) or
(b) above is:

-   A fine not exceeding \$10,000 for the article or for each article in
    respect of which the offence was committed or \$100,000, whichever
    is the lower; and/or
-   Imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years

The penalties imposed for an offence committed under part (c) above is:

-   A fine not exceeding \$50,000; and/or
-   Imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years

The penalties imposed for an offence committed under part (d) above is:

-   A fine not exceeding \$20,000 for each such article in respect of
    which the offence is committed; and/or
-   Imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years

The penalties imposed for an offence committed under part (e) above is:

-   A fine not exceeding \$20,000; and/or
-   Imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years

The law provides that where any person has in his possession five or
more infringing copies of any work or other subject-matter, unless
otherwise proven, is presumed that the possession of the infringing
copies was not for private and domestic use or that such possession was
for the purpose of sale.

### Criminal liability for wilful infringement

It is also a criminal offence if a person wilfully infringes copyright
for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage and/or to the extent
of the infringement significant, which is outside of the offences
contained in parts (a), (b), (c) and (e) above.

Commercial advantage means any direct advantage, benefit or financial
gain for a business or trade. As to whether the infringement is to an
extent that is significant, this is judged based on the volume and value
of any articles that are infringing copies, whether the infringement has
a substantial prejudicial impact on the copyright owner and all other
relevant matters.

The penalties for such wilful copyright infringement are:

-   1st offence, a fine not exceeding \$20,000 and/or imprisonment for a
    term not exceeding 6 months, **or**
-   2nd or subsequent offence, a fine not exceeding \$50,000 and/or
    imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years.

**Other acts that have civil and criminal liabilities include:**

-   Circumventing a technological measure; and
-   Removing or altering the rights management information
    electronically attached to a work.

### Circumvention of technological measures

Copyright owners employ certain technological measures to prevent or
restrict unauthorized access to their digital copyright works. Given the
increasing ease with which these digital works can be reproduced and
disseminated, it has become necessary to protect technological measures
that are employed in connection with the exercise of the owner’s
copyright.

The owner of a copyright work may take action against a person who:

a)  Knowingly circumvents a technological access control measure put in
    place.
b)  Manufactures, imports, distributes, offers to the public, provides
    or otherwise traffics in any device, product or component which:

<!-- -->

### Exceptions to Prohibition on Circumvention of Technological Access Control Measures

The Copyright Act provides for exceptions where the circumvention of a
technological measure which effectively controls access to a work is not
a contravention. These include acts done:

-   To enable a non-profit library, any non-profit archives, an
    educational institution, an institution assisting
    handicapped/intellectually handicapped readers to have access to a
    copyright work which is not otherwise available to the library,
    archives or institution, for the sole purpose of making acquisition
    decisions.
-   For undertaking research on encryption technology.
-   For the sole purpose of achieving inter-operability of an
    independently created computer program with another computer
    program.
-   For the sole purpose of testing, investigating or correcting a
    security flaw or vulnerability of a computer, computer system or
    network.
-   For the sole purpose of preventing access by minors to any material
    on the Internet, **or**
-   For the purpose of law enforcement, intelligence, national defence,
    essential security or other similar purpose.

Right Management Information (RMI)
----------------------------------

Rights management information is used by authors of digital works to
identify their works or to provide information about the copyright work,
including the terms and conditions relating to its use.

Where RMI in electronic form:

-   Is attached to or embodied in a copy of a work or other
    subject-matter in which copyright subsists or a recording of a
    performance, **or**
-   Appears in connection with the communication or making available to
    the public of a copy of a work or other subject-matter or a
    recording of a performance

An action may be brought by the owner or exclusive licensee of the
copyright or the performer against a person who does any of the
following acts:

a)  Knowingly removes or alters the RMI relating to any work or other
    subject-matter or recording of a performance.
b)  Distributes or imports for distribution the rights management
    information relating to any work or other subject-matter or any
    recording of a performance, being rights management information
    which has been altered without the consent of:

<!-- -->

(i) The owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright in the work or
    subject-matter, **or**
(ii) The performer of the performance; **or**

<!-- -->

a)  Distributes, imports for distribution, communicates or makes
    available to the public copies of a work or other subject-matter or
    a recording of a performance in respect of which the rights
    management information has been removed or altered without the
    consent of:

<!-- -->

(i) The owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright in the work or
    subject matter; **or**
(ii) The performer of the performance

and the person performing any of the above acts knows or ought
reasonably to know that the act will induce, enable, facilitate or
conceal an infringement of the copyright in the work or subject-matter
or an unauthorised use of the performance.

Copyright and the Internet
--------------------------

### Copyright Materials on the Internet

All copyright materials are entitled to the same protection, regardless
of whether they are sent over the Internet or stored on web servers. The
fact that they are made available on the Internet does not constitute a
waiver of copyright nor does it carry any implied licence for anyone to
download or reproduce the material without the permission of the
copyright owner.

It is advisable for all copyright owners to maintain documentary
evidence of the date of creation of the work, and to display a notice of
copyright on the material posted on the Internet. Such documentary
evidence will facilitate proof of copyright should there be a need to
enforce the copyright against a third party. *Please refer to the symbol
© and proving originality of work.*

### Webpages

Generally, a webpage is considered subject matter that is entitled to
copyright protection. Individual works (e.g. original music, original
text) within a webpage can also independently enjoy copyright protection
separate from the webpage.

If you wish to hyperlink to a website, it is good practice to check the
terms and conditions of use of the website and the terms and conditions
of use of the works.

### Downloading Materials from the Internet

Downloading materials from the Internet may constitute a copyright
infringement because copying is involved. However, the mentioned
exceptions may apply.

### Browsing

When users browse (view, listen or utilize) copyright works made
available over the Internet, a transient and incidental electronic copy
of the copyright work is created in the user’s computer or other
electronic device in the process of communicating the work to the user.
The making of this transient and incidental copy of the work constitutes
a reproduction of the work.

The Copyright Act provides a specific limited exception for the act of
browsing copyright materials made available on the Internet. The
copyright in a work is not infringed by the making of a temporary or
transient reproduction of the work.

The exception applies only if:

-   The reproduction is made incidentally as part of the technical
    process of making or receiving a communication, **and**
-   The act of making the communication itself does not constitute an
    infringement.

This exception shall NOT apply if the reproduction of the copyright work
that is communicated is:

-   An infringing copy of the work, **or**
-   A reproduction that, if it had been made in Singapore, would have
    been an infringing copy of the copyright work.

### Email Forwarding

Generally, forwarding an email which contains copyright material without
the consent of the copyright owner is an infringement because copying is
involved.

### Liability of Network Service Providers (NSPs)

NSPs provide Internet access services and facilities for communication
across networks, as well as for storage of data. As such, they are the
repository and access point for a high volume of copyright works.
Recognising the need to limit the liability of NSPs for infringement
committed by their users, the Copyright Act provides NSPs with limited
legal liability in copyright infringement suits, subject to the NSP
meeting certain stipulated conditions. One of these conditions is that
the NSP must designate a representative to receive any notice of
infringement served by copyright owners.

NSPs should complete the relevant form on the IPOS website to notify
IPOS of all designated representatives together with prescribed
information thereof, to be listed in the Directory of NSPs administered
and maintained by IPOS. The completed form can be submitted by hand,
mailed, faxed or emailed to IPOS. An administrative fee of \$32 will
apply.

Commonly Asked Questions on Copyright[^4]
-----------------------------------------

### **COPYRIGHT ISSUES AT THE WORKPLACE**[^5]

**Can I forward emails and file attachments from external parties to my
colleagues?**

Forwarding emails and file attachments constitutes reproduction of the
copyright material. You can do so only with the consent of the copyright
owners or if it is a situation of fair dealing (s35 of the Copyright
Act).

The consent of copyright owners can be express or implied. For example,
some emails expressly invite you to forward them to your contacts who
you think may be interested (e.g. publicity on a product launch). Other
emails, by their nature (e.g. where social awareness or public education
is involved), may imply that forwarding is allowed. When in doubt, you
should check with the source.

**Can I install original software bought by my company on my home PC?**

Every time computer software is installed on a PC, a copy is made.
Installation of software should take place with the copyright owner's
consent, which can usually be found within the terms and conditions
accompanying the original software your company bought.

Whether you can also install this software on your home PC depends on
these terms and conditions. It cannot be assumed that legitimate
software bought for office use can also be installed on home PCs.

Usually, there is a variety of licences for a company to choose from
when buying software. In general, the higher the licence fee, the wider
the scope of permitted use.

**I am writing a proposal for my company. Can I:**

-   **Insert images from websites or clipart from legally purchased
    software in my proposal?**
-   **Annex copies of newspaper/magazine/journal articles to my
    proposal?**

Copyright in images and clipart includes the right to make copies.
Making copies without the copyright owner’s permission by using them in
your proposal would constitute infringement, unless the terms and
conditions of use allow such use, or the owner’s consent is sought (s26
of the Copyright Act). These terms and conditions should be available on
the website and in the software agreement that comes with the software.

Similarly, newspaper/magazine/journal articles are also protected by
copyright. You need the copyright owners' consent to make copies before
annexing them to your proposal, unless it is a situation of "fair
dealing". Alternatively, you can annex the actual articles, as clipped
from the newspaper/magazine/journal, to your proposal without making
copies.

*During my presentation at the department meeting, can I screen the
opening scene from an original movie DVD to grab my colleagues'
attention? The scene takes only 1 minute.*\*

Owning an original movie DVD allows you to enjoy the movie privately in
a domestic setting. However, only the copyright owner of a movie has the
exclusive right to show it in public (s26(1)(b)(iii) of the Copyright
Act). The concept of "public" may include workplaces.

As long as the opening scene is a substantial part of the movie (in
quality, rather than quantity), you still need to get the copyright
owner's consent before playing it at your department meeting.

**During our company's Family Day held at a park, can we play music over
the PA system?**

Playing music over the PA system constitutes public performance of
copyrighted works. Thus, although your company’s Family Day is an ad-hoc
event, consent of the copyright owners must be sought. You should
approach COMPASS (Composers and Authors Society of Singapore).

Alternatively, your company can choose to simply connect the PA system
to a local radio station instead of playing music independently. Doing
so is allowed under our copyright law (s43 of the Copyright Act).

**My company is organising a seminar. Can I make a copy of the map
showing the seminar venue and print it on the invitation cards and
publicity material?**

A map is an artistic work protected by copyright. It is necessary to
obtain the copyright owner's consent before reproducing the map in your
invitation cards and publicity material (s26 of the Copyright Act). For
instance, you can simply check with the owner of the venue (e.g. if the
seminar is held on rented premises like a hotel ballroom) whether it has
its own map which it can allow your company to use.

Alternatively, your company can produce its own map for use in its
invitation cards and publicity material.

**My company engaged a vendor to give us training. Since we paid for the
training, can we:**

-   **Make copies of the materials and distribute them to staff who did
    not attend the training?**
-   **Make a video-recording of the training sessions to show the staff
    who did not attend the training?**

As original training materials are protected by copyright, they can only
be reproduced with the permission of the copyright owner or if it is a
situation of "fair dealing". Check the agreement between your company
and the vendor: was it agreed that the training fee includes the right
for your company to make copies of the training materials and a
video-recording of the training? Alternatively, during the training, did
the trainer indicate on behalf of the vendor that your company is free
to make copies of the materials for internal use?

Further, the trainer may deliver the training based on a prepared
script, which is also protected by copyright. Video-recordings of such
training are considered to reproduce the underlying literary work, and
are not permitted in the absence of the owner’s consent. Hence, when in
doubt, you should check with the company whether video-recording is
allowed.

**My company commissioned a graphics designer to design the invitation
cards and publicity posters for a product launch. To save costs, can I
"recycle" the artwork for another event e.g. by simply changing the
event details on the material?**

It depends on what was agreed between your company and the graphics
designer on the use of the artwork and/or ownership of copyright in the
artwork.

In the absence of an agreement between the parties, the default position
is that the graphics designer (or his company, if he is an employee)
owns the copyright (s30 of the Copyright Act). If so, you should only
"recycle" the designs with permission as this involves making copies of
the artwork. Even though the event details will be changed, a
substantial part of the artwork would have been copied and this is
enough to infringe copyright.

In general, it is best to ensure at the outset that the terms of the
engagement suit your company's needs e.g. with allowance for multiple
use in future or with copyright to be owned by your company, at an
agreed price.

**I was interviewed by a journalist who then published a feature in the
newspaper on my company. Can I use the published feature for my
company's publicity e.g. in emails to business associates, in our annual
report, on our company website etc.?**

It depends on how you intend to “use” the published feature. If, in your
publicity, you merely refer to the fact that the newspaper featured your
company, you do not need the newspaper's permission to do so.

However, if you reproduce the newspaper feature in your publicity
material, you will need the copyright owner's consent to do so unless it
is a situation of "fair dealing". The copyright owner may be the
newspaper itself, or the feature writer, especially if he/she is a
freelancer. You should check with the newspaper if in doubt.

**I provide photography services. Do I own the copyright to the photos
that I take for my clients? If I don't, is there any way that I can own
the copyright? I want to showcase the best photos in my website and
brochures.**

The default position is that clients who pay for your services own the
copyright to the photos taken. However, you have limited rights in that
if the photos are required for any particular purpose (e.g. a corporate
client wants glamour shots of the senior management, to use in its
annual report), you are entitled to prevent the photos from being used
for other purposes (s30 of the Copyright Act).

In practice, however, many photographers have their own terms of
engagement with clients. The parties are free to have their own
agreement, which automatically overrides the above default position.
Thus, for example, you and your clients can mutually agree that you will
own the copyright in the photos but that your clients can use the photos
for certain purposes; or that your clients own the copyright but you
have the license to reproduce the photos in your website and brochures.

**I own a music CD retail shop. To promote the latest music CDs, I often
play them in my shop. I was told recently that I may be infringing
copyright. Is this true? If so, what should I do?**

When you play music CDs in your retail shop you are actually
"performing" the copyright works in public, and as such need to
copyright owners consent.

COMPASS (Composers and Authors Society of Singapore) represents most of
the song writers and lyricists and is authorized to collect royalties
for them in return for consent to play the music publicly. Thus, you can
approach them to obtain consent for playing the different music CDs in
your shop. More details are available on its website.

**What can I do if I suspect that another company has infringed my
company's copyright? On the other hand, what can I do if I am accused of
infringing another company's copyright?**

If you suspect that your company's copyright has been infringed, you
should obtain legal advice on the options available in your particular
case. As copyright is a private right, copyright owners generally have
to take action themselves to obtain compensation.

As a practical matter, you should gather as many facts about the
suspected infringement as possible so that your legal advisor can better
advise you. If you threaten legal action without grounds, the party you
suspect has infringed your copyright can sue you for groundless threats
of legal proceedings.

If you are accused of infringing another company's copyright, you should
likewise get hold of the relevant facts and seek legal advice.

Finally, whether you suspect or are suspected of copyright infringement,
going to court is not the only way to deal with the matter. For example,
in cases of unintentional infringement, both parties may be more willing
and find it more cost- and time-effective to negotiate a private
settlement out of court. Parties may also wish to engage a mediator in
their talks. Mediation services are provided by the Singapore Mediation
Centre. For more information, please visit the Singapore Mediation
Centre website (<http://www.mediation.com.sg/>).

**If my employee infringes copyright, e.g. while at work, he illegally
uploads music to the Internet, as the employer, am I also responsible
for my employee's action?**

In general, an employer may be held responsible for an employee's
wrongdoing committed in the course of employment. Copyright owners can
sue both the employee and employer for copyright infringement committed
by the employee.

Furthermore, if a criminal offence is committed by a company its
directors, managers, secretaries and other similar officers are also
personally responsible if the infringement is committed with their
consent or connivance.

Practically, an employer should foster a working environment that
respects intellectual property rights to minimize the risk (please refer
to the next FAQ).

**As an employer, what can I do to ensure that my employees do not
infringe copyright?**

An employer is in the ideal position to take the lead in honouring
intellectual property rights in the workplace. Simple measures go a long
way in establishing the right work culture for a productive and legal
work environment.

Insisting on only original software, having a system of tracking
software installation and un-installation to keep within the limits of
the software licence, running regular internal software audits are some
of the things you can do. It is also important to impress upon employees
the value of respecting copyright as part of a virtuous cycle that
benefits everybody.

For more ideas, you can visit the Business Software Alliance's homepage
or its dedicated Software Asset Management (SAM) site
([http://ww2.bsa.org/country.aspx?sc\\\_lang=en-US-SG](http://ww2.bsa.org/country.aspx?sc\_lang=en-US-SG)).

**I own a graphics design firm. I am told that I can exploit the
copyright in my works by licensing it to other companies. How should I
go about doing so?**

Indeed, copyright, like many other types of property, can be licensed by
the copyright owner to others. Licensing is a useful way to get more
mileage from your copyright (another way is to sell it outright).

As copyright is a private right, it is up to you and your potential
licensees to negotiate the terms of the licence.

### **COPYRIGHT ISSUES AT HOME**[^6]

**We are throwing a housewarming party at our new home. Can we copy the
map showing the location of our home and print it on our invitation
cards?**

A map is an artistic work protected by copyright. Thus, the copyright
owner’s consent is required before you use the map. Another option is
for you to draw your own map to use in the invitation cards.

**Can I record a TV or cable programme and:**

**(a) View it during my leisure time?**

**(b) Show it during a party?**

\(a) Yes, you can do so for your own private and domestic use. This is an
exception recognised under our copyright law (s114 of the Copyright
Act).

\(b) You may do so if the viewing of the programme at a party or other
gathering is regarded as your private and domestic use.

What is private and domestic use often depends on the facts. For
example, if you only invite a select group of friends and relatives to a
gathering, then it is more likely that the viewing of the recorded
programme will be considered as private and domestic. On the other hand,
if you invite a large group of friends and then permit those friends to
invite their own friends, then it is more likely that the viewing of the
recorded programme will be considered to be seen in public. In such a
situation, there is copyright infringement if the copyright owner’s
consent is not sought.

It is important to bear in mind that a recording might be considered to
be communicated to the public even on private property (e.g. party held
in function room of a private condominium).

As an alternative, you may instead choose to watch the actual television
broadcast or cablecast during the party. This is allowed under our
copyright law if the audience is non-paying.

**Can I invite my friends and relatives to my house to watch a movie
if:**

-   **I have bought the original movie DVD?**
-   **I rented the DVD from a rental store?**

In general, our copyright law recognises that the copyright owner, not
the consumer, has the exclusive right to cause the movie to be seen in
public (s26 of the Copyright Act).

Buying an original movie DVD gives you a licence to use it according to
law; you still do not own the copyright in it. (Please see the answer to
question 2 above for a discussion on what may amount to a movie being
seen in public.)

Likewise, renting a movie DVD does not mean you own the copyright to it.
You should read the terms and conditions of use that come with the movie
DVD and ensure that your use falls within their scope. You may come
across terms such as "For private domestic use only", which explicitly
allows you to enjoy the movie privately in a domestic setting.

**I am organising a motivational talk at my condominium's clubhouse. The
event is open only to the residents and their guests (max. 2 per
resident), and is free.**

> **(a) Before the talk, can I play some tracks from original music CDs
> to set the mood?**

**(b) During the talk, can I screen excerpts from original DVDs I own?**

\(a) Generally, you are free to play original music CDs in a private and
domestic setting. However, you cannot do so in a public setting without
a license from the relevant copyright owners, because only the copyright
owners of the sheet music and lyrics of the tracks in the CDs have the
exclusive right of public performance (s26 of the Copyright Act). It
does not matter that the event is free of charge or that the event is
organised on an ad-hoc basis. It also does not matter that the event
takes place on private property.

What is "public" can be relatively wide in scope and depends on factors
such as the size and nature of the audience, which the Court will
consider and determine.

In the present scenario, you are opening the event to ALL residents of
the condominium plus a limited number of guests, the identities of whom
are unknown to you. In such a situation, you may be considered to be
"performing" the sheet music and lyrics in a public setting and will
need a licence from the relevant copyright owners.

This is unlike a situation where you invite a restricted number of your
friends and family to the clubhouse for the event. In this situation, it
is more likely that you would be able to establish that you are playing
the music CDs in a private and domestic setting.

If you are playing the music CDs in a public setting, you should
approach COMPASS (Composers and Authors Society of Singapore) for
licensing permission. More details can be found on the COMPASS website.

Alternatively, you can choose to simply connect the PA system to a local
radio station playing music appropriate for your event instead of
playing CDs. Doing so is allowed under our copyright law.

\(b) Similar to part (a). If you are uncertain whether a screening is
public, it is advisable to check that the copyright owner agrees .

The above issue is a concern even though you only plan to screen movie
excerpts, if the excerpts form a substantial part of the respective
movies. What is "substantial"? This is a question of fact to be
determined case by case. For example, if the excerpts screened comprise
important or readily identifiable scenes in the movie (irrespective of
duration), then it is more likely that you would have screened a
substantial part of the movie. The test, therefore, is qualitative,
rather than purely quantitative.

However, our copyright law does allow you to screen the excerpts for the
specific purpose of criticism or review (e.g. reviewing whether a
particular technique demonstrated in a video DVD is effective), as long
as a sufficient acknowledgement is made (s36 of the Copyright Act).

**Can I lend my original CDs/VCDs/DVDs to my friends?**

Under our copyright law, you can generally do so but take note of the
terms and conditions of use that accompany the CDs/VCDs/DVDs. You may be
subject to certain contractual terms outside of copyright law which can
affect how you may use the CDs/VCDs/DVDs e.g. "Buying this CD gives you,
the Buyer, the licence to enjoy it personally. No public performance,
rental or lending is permitted."

Further, remember that even if your friends may borrow CDs/VCDs/DVDs
from you to listen or view, they do not have free rein to make
unauthorised copies of them!

**I think my computer is going to crash, and I have misplaced all the
CD-ROMs of the programs that are installed in the computer. Can I make
back-ups of the programs in case my computer crashes?**

You can do so if the terms and conditions accompanying the original
(misplaced) CD-ROMs allow. If in doubt, you should check with the
copyright owner. The official website for the software may have
important contact information, FAQs etc. in this regard. Sometimes, the
software retailer could be your first point of contact and enquiry.

In a similar scenario where the original CD-ROMs are still available,
our copyright law does allow the owner of the software to make a back-up
copy of the original CD-ROMs. This is only allowed if the back-up copy
is made for the sole purpose of being used if the original copy is lost,
destroyed or unusable. This exception applies even if the copyright
owner states otherwise in the terms and conditions of use (s39 of the
Copyright Act).

-   Can music, songs, videos and movies from my original
    CDs/VCDs/DVDs:\*\*

**(a) Be copied into other storage media?**

**(b) Be converted into other formats like MP3?**

**(c) Be uploaded onto my personal website/blog?**

All the above acts involve making copies of the copyright-protected
music, songs, videos and movies. Hence, copyright will be infringed
unless it is a situation of "fair dealing" as determined by the Court
(s35 of the Copyright Act) or if it is done for the purpose of criticism
or review (s36 of the Copyright Act), which may be relevant in scenario
(c) where opinions are often expressed. In the latter case, you need to
make a sufficient acknowledgement of the work used. Further, if the
copyright owner takes legal action against you, it is for the Court to
decide whether on the evidence, you have genuinely uploaded the material
for the purpose of criticism or review such that the exception applies.

If the abovementioned exceptions do not apply, you should proceed only
with consent from the copyright owners. This consent may be found in the
terms and conditions accompanying your CDs/VCDs/DVDs. For example, some
record companies expressly state the number of copies you can make of
the music on other devices (e.g. personal computers, MP3 players). If
the terms and conditions do not address your intended use of the music,
songs, videos and movies, you may also contact the copyright owners
directly for consent.

**Can I copy newspaper/magazine/journal articles onto my personal
website/blog? I will acknowledge the source.**

Newspaper/magazine/journal articles are original literary works
protected by copyright. You generally need the copyright owners' consent
to make copies on your website/blog (s26 of the Copyright Act). The
copyright owner may be the newspaper/magazine/journal publisher, or the
individual author, especially if he/she is a freelancer (s30 of the
Copyright Act). You should check with the publisher if in doubt. Merely
acknowledging the source will not be enough to avoid infringing
copyright in the newspaper/magazine/journal articles.

The exception is if it is a situation of "fair dealing" as determined by
the Court, or if it is done for the purpose of criticism or review. For
example, if you share an opinion on a particular magazine feature in
your blog, you may upload and refer to that feature under the latter
exception. In such a case, you will need to identify the title and
author of the magazine feature.

**Can I use images provided by portals such as Google Images and:**

**(a) Create a slideshow to distribute to my friends?**

**(b) Print them to decorate my room?**

**(c) Upload them on my website/blog?**

You can use these images in the above ways if the terms and conditions
of use so allow (e.g. "You may use this image for personal,
non-commercial purposes but please always acknowledge my copyright and
include my contact details in your use"). Look for these terms and
conditions on the website.

If the terms and conditions do not address your intended use of the
images, you may also contact the copyright owners directly for consent.
This is needed because copyright in images includes the right to make
copies, such as when you electronically copy and paste, print or upload
them. Doing so without the copyright owner's permission will infringe
his copyright.

The exception is if it is a situation of "fair dealing" as determined by
the Court or if it is done for the purpose of criticism or review, which
may be relevant in scenario (c) where opinions are often expressed. In
the latter case, a sufficient acknowledgement of the image by its
title/description and author is needed.

**Can I post a video-recording of my sister's birthday celebration onto
websites such as YouTube?**

In general, the maker of a video owns the copyright to it (s30 of the
Copyright Act). When a video-recording is posted onto a website, a copy
is made. This involves the reproduction right of the copyright owner.
Further, the communication right is involved as the video is made
available on the Internet (s26 of the Copyright Act). Thus, if you want
to post the video-recording onto websites like YouTube and you are not
the maker of the video, you should get the consent of the copyright
owner.

Apart from copyright concerns, you may also want to consider Internet
safety and privacy issues before posting the video-recording for the
world at large to view.

**Does watching content online (e.g. exclusive cable TV shows and live
sports events) through various internet live-streaming channels infringe
copyright?**

One has to exercise caution in relation to content available on the
Internet. Not everything that is available for free or technically
possible is being reproduced legally; some of these are from legitimate
copyright owners or their licensees. Others, however, are not. For
example, there are those who steal broadcast signals from authorised
sources and transmit them online illegally.

This has an impact on you because when you watch content online via
streaming technology, a temporary copy of the programme is made on your
computer. You may recall that reproduction is one of the copyright
owner's exclusive rights (s26 of the Copyright Act). If the programme is
communicated without the copyright owner's consent (e.g. in the example
of signal theft above), then the temporary copy on your computer
infringes copyright. In other words, if the source is infringing, the
temporary copy on your computer will also be infringing. If the source
is authorised, the temporary copy on your computer is recognised as an
exception under our copyright law and is therefore non-infringing (s38A
of the Copyright Act).

In view of this, you should be careful and check before watching content
available online. It may not always be possible to tell if the source is
legitimate. If you do not receive a clear and satisfactory response from
the people responsible for putting up the content, it is best to avoid
watching it.

### **COPYRIGHT AND THE INTERNET**[^7]

**I like surfing the Internet and visiting personal websites and blogs.
I found something interesting on someone else's personal website/blog.**

(a) **Can I quote it on my personal website?**
(b) **Can I link to the other person’s personal website/blog?**
(c) **Can I take screen shots of the website/blog and place it on my
    personal website?**
(d) **Can I forward part of the text by email to other people?**

Original website/blog content is protected by copyright. You generally
need copyright owners’ consent to make copies, which is entailed by the
actions in (a) quoting, (c) taking screen shots and (d) forwarding by
email. Check whether any policy or terms of use on the website/blog
address this. You should contact the website/blog owner if in doubt.

On the other hand, you can make copies without the express consent of
copyright owners if it is a situation of “fair dealing” as determined by
the Court, or if it is done for the purpose of criticism or review (s35
and s36 of the Copyright Act).

For example, if you share an opinion on someone else’s blog entry in
your personal website, you may be able to upload and refer to relevant
parts of that blog entry under the latter exception. In such a case, you
will need to identify the title and author of the blog entry. If the
copyright owner takes legal action against you, it is for the Court to
decide whether on the evidence, you have genuinely uploaded the content
for the purpose of criticism or review such that the exception applies.

Checking the policy or terms of use on the website/blog and contacting
the website/blog owner if in doubt are useful, practical steps to apply
to the issue of linking in (b) as well. Generally speaking, copyright
owners could welcome links to their personal website/blog if there are
no other commercial or privacy concerns.

As a point of caution, you should be careful not to create links to
websites/blogs which may carry content that infringes copyright. In such
a case, you yourself might infringe copyright by “authorising
infringement”, in that others make unauthorised copies of the content
using the link on your website/blog (s31 of the Copyright Act).

**I am an avid blogger who blogs on many subjects. I have a comments
section so that readers may post their thoughts.**

> **(a) I would like to let other people use the content on my blog. Can
> I license it?**
>
> **(b) If a reader comments on my blog, does it mean she has licensed
> the rights to me?**

\(a) You can certainly control how your copyright material is used. There
are many ways to exercise this control as a copyright owner, so you
should give it some thought and then communicate your policy clearly on
your blog.

For example, do you want your work to be freely distributed without any
conditions, to maximise your reach without bothering about dollars and
cents? Or do you want to restrict use to only non-commercial
distribution and copying? Will you allow others to modify your work?
Under what circumstances?

There is no fixed format for a license. For some ideas, Creative Commons
(CC), a non-profit organisation, offers a range of flexible copyright
licenses for creative works. You may consider adopting one of CC’s
licences if it suits your needs (see <http://creativecommons.org>).

\(b) It depends on the policy you adopt for your blog. If a reader leaves
a comment, there is at least an implied licence that she allows her
comment to be viewed on your blog. If you intend to use your readers’
comments beyond this, you should state so clearly on your blog. After
all, original comments by readers belong to them, not you.

**Do I own the copyright to pictures and articles that I upload in
citizen journalist websites such as STOMP? Are the website owners
required to seek permission from me before reproducing the picture or
article elsewhere?**

In general, the person who took the picture, or, in the case of an
article, its author, is the copyright owner. Hence, if you took the
picture or wrote the article yourself, you own the copyright. If someone
else took the picture or wrote the article, the fact that you uploaded
the picture or article does not make you the copyright owner. In fact,
you would need the copyright owner’s permission before uploading the
picture or article (s30 of the Copyright Act).

Citizen journalist websites have their own policies regarding copyright
issues and this may vary from site to site. You should be familiar with
these policies (sometimes referred to as “Copyright Policy” or “Terms
and Conditions of Use” on the sites) before using the sites.

Often, citizen journalist websites expressly require you not to be in
breach of copyright law when you upload material. Thus, you should be
careful to upload only copyright material that you own, or for which
clearance has been given, or where an exception applies. Through their
stated copyright policy or terms and conditions of use, citizen
journalist websites also typically obtain your license to reproduce and
distribute the material you uploaded without the need to check with you
each time they do so.

**Can I upload photos and videos of live events (e.g. soccer matches,
concerts) taken from my camera phone or digital camera onto my personal
website/blog?**

It depends.

For instance, live sports events in themselves are not protected by
copyright. Hence, you will not infringe copyright by taking and
uploading photos and videos that you took at the sports event itself. On
the other hand, broadcasts of sports events are protected by copyright
(s84 of the Copyright Act). If you take videos of these broadcasts, and
upload them onto your personal website/blog, you will infringe copyright
in the broadcasts.

As for live concerts, if you take videos at the concerts themselves, you
run the risk of infringing the underlying musical and literary works
when you upload them onto your website/blog (s26 of the Copyright Act).
The exception is if it is a situation of “fair dealing” as determined by
the Court or if it is done for the purpose of criticism or review, which
may be relevant in relation to websites/blogs where opinions are often
expressed (s35 and s36 of the Copyright Act). In the latter case, you
need to make a sufficient acknowledgement of the work used. Further, if
the copyright owner takes legal action against you, it is for the Court
to decide whether on the evidence you have genuinely uploaded relevant
parts of the material for the purpose of criticism or review such that
the exception applies.

-   Can music, songs, videos and movies from my original
    CDs/VCDs/DVDs:\*\*

**(a) Be uploaded onto my personal website/blog?**

**(b) Be sent to my family and friends over Microsoft/Yahoo messenger?**

The above acts involve making copies of the copyright-protected music,
songs, videos and movies. Hence, copyright will be infringed unless it
is a situation of “fair dealing” as determined by the Court or if it is
done for the purpose of criticism or review, which may be relevant in
scenario (a) where opinions are often expressed. In the latter case, you
need to make a sufficient acknowledgement of the work used. Further, if
the copyright owner takes legal action against you, it is for the Court
to decide whether on the evidence, you have genuinely uploaded relevant
parts of the material for the purpose of criticism or review such that
the exception applies.

If the abovementioned exceptions do not apply, you should proceed only
with consent from the copyright owners.

**Can I use images provided by portals such as Google Images and upload
them on my website/blog?**

Only if the terms and conditions of use on the website so allow (e.g.
“You may use this image for personal, non-commercial purposes but please
always acknowledge my copyright and include my contact details in your
use”).

If the terms and conditions do not address your intended use of the
images, you may also contact the copyright owners directly for consent.
Copyright in images includes the right to make copies and to communicate
them, such as when you upload them onto your website/blog (s26 of the
Copyright Act). Doing so without the copyright owner’s permission will
infringe his exclusive rights (s31 of the Copyright Act).

The exception is if it is a situation of “fair dealing” as determined by
the Court or if it is done for the purpose of criticism or review (s35
and s36 of the Copyright Act). In the latter case, a sufficient
acknowledgement of the image by its title/description and author is
needed.

**Can I copy articles onto my personal website/blog? I will acknowledge
the source.**

Articles from newspapers, books and other forms of publications are
protected by copyright. You generally need the copyright owners’ consent
to make copies on your website/blog (s26 of the Copyright Act). erely
acknowledging the source will not be enough to avoid infringing
copyright in the publications.

The exception is if it is a situation of “fair dealing” as determined by
the Court, or if it is done for the purpose of criticism or review (s35
and s36 of the Copyright Act). For example, if you share an opinion on a
particular magazine feature in your blog, you may upload and refer to
relevant parts of that feature under the latter exception. In such a
case, you will need to identify the title and author of the magazine
feature.

**I am undertaking research on a particular topic. Can I copy material
from the Internet?**

Original internet content is protected by copyright, just as other
original content in printed form. You generally need copyright owners’
consent to copy their internet content. Check whether any policy or
terms of use on the website/blog address this.

On the other hand, you can copy the content without the express consent
of copyright owners if it is done for purposes of research or study (s35
of the Copyright Act).

However, the amount copied must be a “reasonable portion” of the
original work. Under our copyright law, this means you can only copy up
to 10% of the number of pages, words or bytes , or one chapter,
whichever is more.

If you copy more than a “reasonable portion” of the internet content for
your research, this may still be allowed if it is a situation of “fair
dealing” as determined by the Court. As a practical point, if you need
to copy more than a “reasonable portion”, it is prudent to contact the
copyright owner for clearance at the outset, if the policy or terms of
use on the website/blog do not address this.

**I am a fan of the Star Wars movie series and a few cartoon series. Can
I make tribute videos using pictures of my favourite stars or cartoon
characters from these series and upload them on YouTube?**

Generally, a tribute video would reproduce parts of the films in the
series as well as perform part of the underlying script; further
uploading it on YouTube involves communication, which is the copyright
owners’ exclusive right. If the parts used are substantial in terms of
their distinctiveness and importance to the original series, it may be a
case of copyright infringement (s26 and s31 of the Copyright Act).

However, tribute videos may be allowed, without the copyright owners’
consent, if the Courts find that they qualify as "fair dealing" (s35 of
the Copyright Act).

From a practical perspective, the stance of different copyright owners
in relation to tribute videos will vary. Some may believe that tribute
videos enhance the value of their original works and boost sales. Others
want to safeguard the integrity of their original works, exercise
stronger control and not tolerate unauthorised versions or adaptations
in circulation. .

**I want to parody a character (either fictitious or real) in my
blog/website. Can I use some of the images and text from the movie/book
in my parody?**

Copying images and text from the movie/book infringes copyright if the
parts taken are substantial. Further uploading them onto your
blog/website could also infringe because that involves communication,
which is the copyright owners’ exclusive right (s26 of the Copyright
Act).

The exception is if it is a situation of “fair dealing” as determined by
the Court, or if it is done for the purpose of criticism (s36 of the
Copyright Act). For example, if your parody expresses a criticism of the
work from which the character is parodied, you may be able to upload
your parody under the latter exception. In such a case, you will need to
identify the title and author of the source. If the copyright owner
takes legal action against you, it is for the Court to decide whether on
the evidence, you have genuinely uploaded the parody for the purpose of
criticism such that the exception applies.

**Can I post a video-recording of my sister’s birthday celebration onto
websites such as YouTube?**

In general, the maker of a video owns the copyright to it (s30 of the
Copyright Act). When a video-recording is posted onto a website, a copy
is made. This involves the reproduction right of the copyright owner.
Further, the communication right is involved as the video is made
available on the Internet. Thus, if you want to post the video-recording
onto websites like YouTube and you are not the maker of the video, you
should obtain the consent of the copyright owner.

Apart from copyright concerns, you may also want to consider Internet
safety and personal privacy issues before posting the video-recording
for the world at large to view.

**My friend took a very nice photograph. Can I upload the photograph
onto my personal website/blog?**

When you upload a photograph onto your personal website/blog, you are
both making a copy of a copyright work, as well as communicating it to
the public. Since these actions are exclusive to the copyright owner,
you should obtain his/her agreement before uploading.

Usually, the person who takes the photograph owns the copyright (s30 of
the Copyright Act). For example, if the shot is from your friend’s
personal travel album, he is the right person to approach for consent.
However, if your friend was commissioned to take the photograph by
another person who pays him, that other person is the copyright owner,
not your friend, unless their contract states otherwise. In the latter
case, your friend will have no right to “agree” to you uploading the
photograph onto your website/blog.

### **COPYRIGHT FOR EDUCATORS**[^8]

Copyright impacts educators significantly. This is because educators
often use copyright works for purposes of teaching. IPOS has prepared a
special Copyright Infosheet just for educators which is accessible at
this link[^9].

### **OTHERS**[^10]

**If I use copyright work, can I acknowledge the source of the work
(i.e. with a footnote or in a bibliography) instead of seeking the
owner's permission?**

Unless the use of the work is for the purpose of criticism or review,
any reproduction of copyright materials without the prior permission of
the copyright owner is an infringement. The mere acknowledgement of the
source does not amount to obtaining the permission of the copyright
owner.

**Can I paraphrase an article?**

As it is the expression of ideas that is protected by copyright, you
will not infringe copyright if you express in your own words the
information or ideas presented in the article.

Trade Marks
-----------

A trade mark is a sign that you can use to distinguish your business’
goods or services from those of other traders.

**The conditions are:**

(a) The sign that can be represented graphically, **and**
(b) The sign must be capable of distinguishing the goods or services
    dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods
    or services so dealt with or provided by any other person

### Benefits Of Registering A Trade Mark

In Singapore, it is not compulsory to register a trade mark. However
through a registered trade markyou can protect your brand (or “mark”) by
restricting other people from using its name or logo. Once acquired, a
trade mark can last indefinitely as long as you renew it every 10 years.
Because a registered trade mark is a form of IP, you can license or
assign it to others.

On the other hand, for a mark that is not registered, you may rely on
your rights under the common law action of "passing off" to protect your
mark against imitation or infringement.

However, if you register a trade mark in relation to your goods and/or
services, you are effectively gaining a statutory monopoly of your mark.
A trade mark can add value to your business because it can be used to
protect your market share, be licensed to third parties such as a
franchisee, or be sold sell outright for a specified value. You can also
use a trade mark to help raise equity for the development of your
business.

### Classification Of Trade Marks

Singapore uses the International Classification of Goods and Services,
under the Nice Agreement, to classify trade mark registrations. This
classification sets out 34 different classes of goods and 11 classes of
services that a trader can register in relation to a mark.

The following can be registered as a trade mark but a mark must be
distinctive and capable of distinguishing your goods or services from
similar ones of other traders:

-   Letters
-   Words
-   Names
-   Signatures
-   Labels
-   Devices
-   Tickets
-   Shapes
-   Colours

or any combination of these elements.

### Trade Marks That Cannot Be Registered

The following shall not be registered:

(a) Signs which do not satisfy the definition of a trade mark.
(b) Trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character.
(c) Trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which
    may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity,
    intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production
    of goods or of rendering of services, or other characteristics of
    goods or services, **and**
(d) Trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which
    have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide
    and established practices of the trade.

### Trade Mark Symbols

If you successfully register a trade mark, you are permitted to use the
® symbol next to your mark. Another common symbol associated with trade
mark is ™ − this denotes that the mark is being used by the company as
their trade mark but it does not mean that the mark is registered or
protected under the trade mark law.

Applying to Register a Trade Mark in Singapore
----------------------------------------------

### Before applying

Before you apply, you should conduct a thorough search of existing trade
marks in the records maintained by the Registry of Trade Marks. It is
important to ensure that there is no prior trade mark that is similar or
identical to the one you intend to use. Go to eTrademarks to access the
Similar Mark Search. If there exists a similar mark (used on similar
goods or services), IPOS would raise an objection to your application.

Additionally, you would need to determine the goods and services in
respect of your trade mark application. In accordance with the NICE
Classification, goods and services are divided into 45 classes (Class
1-34 being Classes of Goods, and Class 35-45 being Classes of Services).
The class headings of the Nice Classification give general information
about the types of goods and services which belong to each class. A
specification indicating the class heading does not amount to a claim
for all the goods or services in that class. To register your trade
mark, you are required to state the exact class number and appropriate
specification according to the Nice Classification.

When to register

There is no time limit for registering your trade mark – you might have
been using your logo in conjunction with the ™ symbol for some time (or
even without the symbol). However, a trade mark has to be registered in
order to bring a suit for infringement of a registered trade mark.
Registration takes effect from the date you file your trade mark
application.

In Singapore, there is a priority claim procedure in place for
applicants who have filed an earlier claim for the same mark in another
Paris Convention country or a World Trade Organisation member country
(other than Singapore). The Singapore application must be filed within
six months from the date of the first filing.

### Application

In order to obtain an official filing date, the application shall:

-   Contain a request for the registration of a trade mark
-   State the name and address of the applicant
-   Contain a clear representation of the trade mark
-   List the goods or services in relation to which the applicant seeks
    to register the trade mark **and**
-   State:

(i) That the trade mark is being used in the course of trade, by the
    applicant or with his consent, in relation to those goods or
    services, **or**
(ii) That the applicant has a bona fide intention that the trade mark
    should be so used

Your application can be submitted as follows:

-   Apply and pay the appropriate fee via the IPOS eTrademarks online
    facility; or
-   Download your forms at the IPOS website and send or take your
    completed application to:

**Registrar of Trade Marks, Registry of Trade Marks**

> Intellectual Property Office of Singapore

51 Bras Basah Road, \#01-01 Manulife Centre

Singapore 189554

### Applying through IPOS to register a trade mark outside Singapore

### **Before applying**

If you wish to register a trade mark in countries outside of Singapore,
you will have to make a separate application in accordance with the
trade mark policies of each territory. You can make individual
applications within each country or via the Madrid Protocol (an
internationally recognised system for international registration of
trade marks).

The Madrid Protocol, administered by the International Bureau of the
WIPO in Switzerland, allows a trade mark owner to seek protection of the
trade mark in several countries simultaneously by filing one application
with a single office, in one language and by paying one fee (in Swiss
Francs).

An international trade mark registration is valid for 10 years and can
be renewed every 10 years. However, for the first five years, the
international registration remains totally dependent on the validity of
the mark that has been registered or applied for in the country of
origin.

### **Filing an international application in Singapore**

You must be a resident or national of Singapore (or have a real and
effective industrial or commercial establishment in Singapore) if you
wish to utilise the Madrid Protocol system to acquire a registered trade
mark across a number of countries.

As a first step, you will need to apply or register your mark in
Singapore, a contracting country under the Madrid Protocol. The goods or
services in your international application must be covered by your
Singapore mark. You can then use your Singapore mark as a base for an
international application. The countries in which you are seeking
registration must be Madrid Protocol member countries.

Term and renewal

If your trade mark registration application is successful, the trade
mark will be valid for 10 years from the initial filing date. However,
protection of your mark can be indefinite if you pay the necessary
renewal fees after each 10-year period.

Infringement of Registered Trademark
------------------------------------

**A. If a person infringes your registered trade mark, you can exercise
your rights under the Trade Marks Act.**

A person infringes a registered trade mark if, without the consent of
the proprietor of the trade mark, he uses in the course of trade a sign
which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services
which are identical with those for which it is registered; or

-   Without the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark he uses in
    the course of trade a sign where:

    > \(a) The sign is identical with the trade mark and is used in relation to
    > goods or services similar to those for which the trade mark is
    > registered; or
    >
    > \(b) The sign is similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to
    > goods or services identical with or similar to those for which the trade
    > mark is registered,
    >
    > there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public;
    > or

-   A person infringes a registered trade mark which is well known in
    Singapore if:

(a) Without the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark, he uses in
    the course of trade a sign which is identical with or similar to the
    trade mark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to
    those for which the trade mark is registered;
(b) The use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services
    would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the
    proprietor;
(c) There exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public
    because of such use; and
(d) The interests of the proprietor are likely to be damaged by such
    use.

**B. Under the Trade Marks Act , “well known trade mark” means:**

(a) Any registered trade mark that is well known in Singapore; or

\(b) Any unregistered trade mark that is well known in Singapore and that
belongs to a person who:

(i) Is a national of a Convention country; **or**

\(ii) Is domiciled in, or has a real and effective industrial or
commercial establishment

in, a Convention country,

whether or not that person carries on business, or has any goodwill, in
Singapore.

There is no requirement to prove that the infringer caused any damage to
the registered trade mark proprietor.

**C. If there is an infringement on your registered trade mark, you can
seek the following:**

(a) An injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the Court thinks
    fit)
(b) Damages
(c) An account of profits **and**
(d) Statutory damages (where the infringement involves the use of a
    counterfeit trade mark in relation to goods or services).

Revocation and Invalidation of Trade Marks
------------------------------------------

**A. The registration of a trade mark may be revoked if:**

(a) Within the period of 5 years following the date of completion of the
    registration procedure, it has not been put to genuine use in the
    course of trade in Singapore, by the proprietor or with his consent,
    in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and
    there are no proper reasons for non-use.
(b) Such use has been suspended for an uninterrupted period of 5 years,
    and there are no proper reasons for non-use.
(c) In consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, it has
    become the common name in the trade for the product or service for
    which it is registered.
(d) In consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor or with his
    consent in relation to the goods or services for which it is
    registered, it is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to
    the nature, quality or geographical origin of those goods or
    services.

**B. A trade mark can become invalid if:**

(a) There is an earlier trade mark in relation which:
(b) Is identical and which the goods or services for which the trade
    mark is to be registered is identical; **or**

<!-- -->

(ii) Is identical and which the goods or services for which the trade
    mark is to be registered is similar and there exists a likelihood of
    confusion on the part of the public; **or**
(iii) Is similar and which the goods or services for which the trade
    mark is to be registered is identical and there exists a likelihood
    of confusion on the part of the public; **or**
(iv) Before 1^st^ July 2004, is identical or similar and is to be
    registered for goods or services which are not similar and that:

<!-- -->

i.  The earlier trade mark is well known in Singapore;
ii. Use of the later trade mark in relation to the goods or services for
    which the later trade mark is sought to be registered would indicate
    a connection between those goods or services and the proprietor of
    the earlier trade mark;
iii. There exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public
    because of such use; and
iv. The interests of the proprietor of the earlier trade mark are likely
    to be damaged by such use; or

<!-- -->

(i) On or after 1st July 2014, the whole or an essential part is
    identical with or similar and if:

<!-- -->

i.  The earlier trade mark is well known in Singapore; and
ii. Use of the later trade mark in relation to the goods or services for
    which the later trade mark is sought to be registered:

<!-- -->

a.  Would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the
    proprietor of the earlier trade mark, and is likely to damage the
    interests of the proprietor of the earlier trade mark; or
b.  If the earlier trade mark is well known to the public at large in
    Singapore:

<!-- -->

A.  Would cause dilution in an unfair manner of the distinctive
    character of the earlier trade mark; or
B.  Would take unfair advantage of the distinctive character of the
    earlier trade mark; or

<!-- -->

(a) There is an earlier right in relation to which the following
    conditions are satisfied:
(b) Its use in Singapore is liable to be prevented:

<!-- -->

i.  By virtue of any rule of law (in particular, the law of passing off)
    protecting an unregistered trade mark or other sign used in the
    course of trade; or
ii. By virtue of an earlier right other than those referred to in (a)(i)
    to (iv) or (b)(i)i above, in particular by virtue of the law of
    copyright or any law with regard to the protection of designs.

    unless the proprietor of that earlier trade mark or other earlier
    right has consented to the registration.

Passing Off
-----------

The law of passing off aims to provide relief to traders in cases of
deceptive business practices. Since the 19^th^ century, the action of
passing off has gradually expanded to cover several forms of deceptive
misappropriation by a trader of another’s business reputation.

**Some examples are:**

-   Misrepresentation as to the quality of goods
-   Misrepresentation as to a connection or association between the
    trader and his competitor, **and**
-   Misrepresentation as to endorsement and merchandising of the goods

However, courts have refused to recognise the right of a trader under
passing off as a fully-fledged property right in the mark or sign,
leaving the protection of the property right in the trade mark or sign
to the sole purview of the registered trade mark regime.

In an action of passing off, the protection extended to the goodwill
enjoyed by the trader in his business.

### Passing off and trade mark

In Singapore, the law of passing of is expressly preserved by the Trade
Marks Act. The 2 systems of protection co-exist. Both passing off and
registered trade marks protect a trader’s indicators of trade origin.
Despite that, there are important distinctions between the 2 forms of
IP.

A registered trade mark can be protected even without prior use. An
action for passing off requires that the trader has used his mark or
get-up in connection with his business and is able to establish
goodwill. As such, it provides important protection especially to small
traders who may not have registered their trade indicators.

Passing off provides protection to marks or get-up that are unable to
obtain registration because they do not meet the required registration
requirement, either because they are not capable of graphic
representation or because they are devoid of any distinctive character,
are exclusively descriptive or customary in the current language and
would hence be refused registration.

### Elements

The Singapore Court of Appeal has endorsed and approved the 3 elements
of passing off as set out in the UK case of **Reckitt & Colman Products
Ltd v Borden Inc** \[1990\] 1 WLR 491.

**The 3 elements are:**

(a) **Goodwill:** There must firstly be a business, trade or calling. A
    mere non-use *per se* is not enough to constitute an abandonment of
    a business, trade or calling. It is a question of fact and degree.
    Goodwill is of value, not only in respect of current business but
    also because of future business opportunities it will nurture. It is
    important to note that there is a difference between goodwill and
    reputation. The former cannot subsist independently of the business
    to which it is attached while the latter may and often does exist
    without any supporting business.
(b) **Misrepresentation:** There must be a misrepresentation made by the
    defendant to the public causing confusion as to the origins of the
    goods or services of the plaintiff. It does not matter even if the
    defendant made the misrepresentation through complete innocence
    although this may be a factor to consider in the award of damages.
    The false statement could relate to the source or origin of the
    goods or services. It may also be made as to the quality of the
    goods or services or even to a business connection or association
    between the plaintiff and the defendant.
(c) **Likelihood of damage:** The plaintiff must establish that he
    suffers or is likely to suffer damage by reason of the deception by
    the defendant’s misrepresentation, whether it is as to the source,
    quality or trade connection between the plaintiff and the defendant.
    There needs to be proof of actual damage or a real likelihood of
    damage of the plaintiff’s goodwill established as a matter of
    probability and not mere possibility.

### Remedies

The plaintiff has the following remedies:

(a) Injunctions
(b) Order for delivery up
(c) Damages, **or**
(d) Account of profits

### Defences

When a defendant is being sued for passing off, he could rely on the
following defences:

(a) He is merely selling the plaintiff’s own goods
(b) He has an independent or concurrent right to use the mark or get-up
    concerned, **or**
(c) The plaintiff is prevented from suing him by estoppel, laches or
    acquiescence.

Registered Designs
------------------

Registered Designs are used primarily to protect designs for industrial
use. A design refers to the features of a shape, configuration, pattern
or ornament applied to an article by any industrial process. Registering
a design will protect the external appearance of the article.

### Registration of designs

By registering a design, you obtain a right to ownership and the right
to prevent others from using the design without your permission. You can
exploit your design in many ways. You may use it to better protect your
market share by barring copying by others, license it to third parties
for commercial returns or sell the design for a sum of money.

To qualify for registration, a design must satisfy:

(a) a “**design**” within the meaning of the Registered Designs Act
(b) the design is “**new**”
(c) the applicant is the “**owner of the design**”, and
(d) the design is to be applied to an “**article**”
(e) **A “design” within the meaning of the Registered Designs Act:**
    Features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament applied to an
    article by any industrial process, but does not include:

<!-- -->

a)  A method or principle of construction; or
b)  Features a shape or configuration of an article which:

<!-- -->

(i) are dictated solely by the function which the article has to
    perform;
(ii) are dependent upon the appearance of another article of which the
    article

> is intended by the designer to form an integral part; or

(i) enable the article to be connected to, or placed in, around or
    against,

    another article so that either article may perform its function.

<!-- -->

(a) **The design is “new”:** The design must not have been registered in
    Singapore or elsewhere, or published anywhere in the world, in
    respect of the same or any other article, before the date of
    application of the first filing. Furthermore, the design must not
    differ only in immaterial details, or features, from other designs
    that are commonly found in trade. Therefore, the owner of a design
    should be careful not to disclose the design to anyone until a
    design application is filed.
(b) **The applicant is the “owner of the design”:** The applicant must
    be the person who creates it or, if there are 2 or more such
    persons, each of those persons.
(c) **The design is to be applied to an “article”:** The registered
    design has to be applied to an article by an industrial process.
    This means that more than 50 copies of the article must have been or
    are intended to be produced for sale or hire.

### Designs that cannot be registered

Under the Registered Designs Act and Rules, the following cannot be
registered:

-   Designs that are contrary to public order or morality
-   Computer program or layout-designs
-   Wall plaques, medals and medallionsPrinted matter primarily of a
    literary or artistic character, including book jackets, calenders,
    certificates, coupons, dress-making patterns, greeting cards,
    labels, leaflets, maps, plans, playing cards, postcards, stamps,
    trade advertisements, trade forms and cash, transfers and similar
    articles

### Applying to register a design in Singapore

#### **Before application**

It is important to conduct a search of existing designs to ensure its
registrability. You can use the IPOS eDesigns search resource and the
search terminals available at the IPOS Public Search area to carry out
your search. You may also wish to check the databases of other
countries.

#### **When to register**

You should register your design at the earliest opportunity as the
design registration system in Singapore operates on a first-to-file
basis. Hence the first person to file an application will, in general,
have priority over others.

In Singapore, there is a priority application procedure in place for
applicants who have filed an earlier application for the same design in
another Paris Convention country or a World Trade Organisation member
country (other than Singapore). The Singapore application must be filed
within six months from the date of the first filing.

#### **Application**

Download your forms at the IPOS website and send; or take your completed
application to:

| **Registry of Designs - Intellectual Property Office of Singapore**
| 51 Bras Basah Road, \#01-01 Manulife Centre, Singapore 189554
| 

#### Term and Renewal

If your design registration is successful, you will own the design for
an initial five years from the date of filing the registration. The
registration can then be renewed every five years up to a maximum of 15
years, subject to the payment of the extension fees.

Exclusive rights conferred by registration

Section 30(1) of the Registered Designs Act provides that the
registration of a design gives to the registered owner the exclusive
right:

(a) To make in Singapore or import into Singapore:
(b) For sale or hire

<!-- -->

(ii) For use for the purpose of trade or business

<!-- -->

(a) to sell, hire, or offer or expose for sale or hire, in Singapore,

any article in respect of which the design is registered and to which
that design or a design not substantially different from it has been
applied.

### Infringement

Section 30(2) of the Registered Designs Act provides that the right in a
registered design is infringed by any person who, without the consent of
the registered owner and while the registration is in force:

(a) Does anything which by virtue of subsection (1) is the exclusive
    right of the registered owner.
(b) Makes anything for enabling any article referred to in subsection
    (1) to be made in Singapore or elsewhere.
(c) Does anything in relation to a kit that would constitute an
    infringement of the design if it had been done in relation to the
    assembled article, **or**
(d) Makes anything for enabling a kit to be made or assembled, in
    Singapore or elsewhere, if the assembled article would be an article
    referred to in subsection (1).

There would be an infringement if the infringing article bears a design
which is exactly the same to that which has been registered or if the
infringing article bears a design which is not substantially different
to that which has been registered.

When making comparison, the whole of the shape and configuration of the
registered design are to be taken into account.

### Enforcement

Under the Registered Designs Actthe plaintiff has the following
remedies:

a)  Injunctions
b)  Damages, **or**
c)  Account of profits

Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
------------------------------------------

A trade secret is some information or "secret" that is important to the
business or company and is not known to the public. It is a term
commonly used to cover information that has commercial value and would
give a business or company an edge over its competitors. The law on
"trade secrets" is really about the protection of confidential
information.

The law protects this information as a secret from everyone except
certain key people in the business or company. Therefore, legal action
can be taken against someone who reveals this secret information to
others, especially when he is aware that it is a secret. This rests on
the nature of the doctrine of confidentiality, in that the information
parted to someone is to be kept in the strictest fiduciary-like secrecy.

There are no registration procedures, and there is no specified time
limit within which the secret may be protected. When a trade secret is
leaked out, this breach of confidence (that is, the breaking of the
promise of keeping the secret) is an action that may be taken in court
which an aggrieved party may rely upon against the disclosing party.

However, not all information can be considered a trade secret. To
determine whether there has been a breach of confidence, the court will
consider the following:

(a) The information must have the necessary quality of confidence about
    it.
(b) The information must have been imparted in circumstances importing
    an obligation of confidence.
(c) There must be an unauthorised use of the information to the
    detriment of the party communicating it.

### Confidential Information

To have the “necessary quality of confidence”, the information must not
already be available to the public at large. It does not have to be new,
inventive or special, as any ordinary or mundane information can be the
subject matter of confidence provided it is private to the person who
discloses the information, even though others could gather similar
information if they took the trouble to do so. The information can
relate to technical, commercial and personal matters (e.g., price lists,
customer lists and financial statements). Mere gossip or information
relating to scandalous or immoral material is not protectable.

In general, information is likely to be considered to be confidential
and therefore protectable if:

(a) The owner of the information believes that the release of the
    information would be injurious to him or of advantage to his rivals.
(b) The owner believes the information to be confidential or secret and
    not already in the public domain.
(c) The owner’s belief in respect of (a) and (b) above is reasonable,
    **and**
(d) The information must be judged in the light of usages and practices
    of the particular trade or industry concerned[^11].

In an action for breach of confidence, the owner must clearly and
specifically identify the confidential information that is alleged to
have been wrongly disclosed or used by the defendant[^12].

### Confidential Obligation

The obligation can arise by contract or by implication of law, such as
where there is a duty of good faith as in the relationship between a
lawyer and his client, a banker and his customer and an employer and his
employee. Another situation in which such an implication would arise is
where a person discusses his information (e.g. business plan) with a
potential business partner with a view to commercially exploiting the
information. A person who is given confidential information will not be
bound by the obligation if he is unaware (and has no reason to be aware)
of the confidential nature of the information.

An ex-employee is not bound by the duty of good faith. He is permitted
to make use of his memory of the information that he has acquired during
employment, except trade secrets and information covered by the express
term of his employment contract. Whether the information is to be
regarded as a trade secret depends on such factors as:

a)  The nature of the employment.
b)  The nature of the information itself.
c)  Whether the employer impressed on the employee the confidentiality
    of the information, **and**
d)  Whether the relevant information can be easily isolated from other
    information which the employee is free to disclose[^13].

### Unauthorised Use

A person who has acquired confidential information under confidential
circumstances is under an obligation not to disclose or use the
information. Whether there is such an obligation on him depends on if it
is conscionable for a recipient of confidential information to disclose
or use the information in the circumstances in question[^14]. The test
is objective. He is liable even if he does not appreciate the
confidentiality of the information[^15], has no intention to take
advantage of the information **(Interfirm Comparisons v Law Society of
New South Wales** \[1977\] RPC 137[^16]), or uses the information
“subconsciously”[^17] ().

A third party to whom confidential information has been wrongfully
disclosed would not be liable for disclosing or using the information if
he is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the
confidentiality of the information ([^18]). But once he knows that the
information was originally given in confidence, he can be restrained
from disclosing or using the information[^19] ().

Unauthorised disclosure is allowed if it is in the public interest or
there is a just cause or excuse (e.g. to prevent cover-up of a
wrongdoing)[^20].

### Remedies

Where the requirements are established, the owner of the confidential
information can apply to the court for an interlocutory and final
injunctions, damages, account of profits, and an order for delivery up
or destruction and constructive trust in the copyright of a book if it
was published in breach of confidence.

Maintaining Confidentiality
---------------------------

The best way of protecting confidential information is to make sure that
no one else knows the information. Ways to protect the confidentiality
of information include:

-   Only allowing certain people to access such confidential
    information.
-   Having employees sign contracts called non-disclosure agreements,
    which provide that they have to maintain confidential, specific
    information that is disclosed to them.
-   Having non-disclosure agreements signed by anyone else who comes in
    contact with the company, such as consultants or vendors, and who
    have the chance to learn about the confidential information, and/or
-   Keeping a clear record of all business deals that may cover any
    confidential information.

### Patents and confidential information

Generally, it is not possible to maintain a patent and ensure
non-disclosure of confidential information for the same invention. Under
patent law, the owner of the invention obtains a 20-year monopoly to
exclude others from making, using or selling the invention without his
consent. In return, the owner makes a full disclosure of the invention
for the world to know. Thus, details on/about a patented invention can
never be kept confidential.

### Copyright and confidential information

Confidential information with copyrightable material will be protected
by both copyright law and law regarding confidential information. One
such example is a computer software programme. With inherent copyright
protection for the software programme, the owner may commercialise the
software product while maintaining confidentiality of the underlying
architecture, algorithms and source code.

### Confidential information

The law of confidential information in Singapore is based on the English
common law doctrine of breach of confidentiality. It prevents
unauthorised persons from using the confidential information.

The law protects personal information imparted in circumstances
importing a duty of confidentiality, as well as commercial/business
information and technical/industrial information. Ideas per se can be
protected as confidential information. Inventions and processes which
cannot be patented may be protected under this.

The extent of protection is often dependant on what the courts view as
reasonable and can even be indefinite. Contracts are used to ensure that
parties keep confidential information disclosed to them. The
enforceability of such contracts depends on the country where protection
is sought. Therefore, if one wishesto ensure that his/her rights to
confidential information are actionable in Singapore, it is advisable
that a governing law clause be made in favour of Singapore within the
confidentiality / non-disclosure agreement.

Implementing internal and external safeguards to maintain the
confidentiality of confidential and proprietary information is of
critical importance. Instituting a comprehensive employee program,
placing special protective notices and legends on materials which
indicate that such materials contain confidential and proprietary
information, maintaining physical security measures, and placing
appropriate nondisclosure provisions in agreements with third parties
are some of these internal and external safeguards.

There are a multitude of internal procedures that a company can adopt to
enhance its claim that it is reasonably protecting its confidential
information and demonstrate its intention to keep its confidential and
proprietary information confidential. Establishing an employee program
to protect confidential information is the most important internal
procedure. Such a program includes the following:

-   Requiring all salaried employees to sign written non-disclosure
    agreements as a condition of their hiring; **and**
-   Similarly requiring all hourly employees to sign statements reciting
    the company’s policies with respect to its confidential and
    proprietary information.

The employee program should also include placing notices of the
company’s policies with respect to its confidential and proprietary
information prominently on bulletin boards and other areas in which
employees would be likely to see them (e.g., the company lunchroom), and
disseminating memoranda to employees on an annual basis to remind them
of company policies. Finally, a company’s employee program should
include the performance of exit interviews when employees leave the
company’s employment. During these exit interviews, the employee should
be reminded of the company’s policies with regard to its confidential
and proprietary information.

In addition to the employee program, there should be a reasonable level
of physical security at company offices to physically safeguard its
confidential and proprietary information. Some common physical security
measures that should seriously be considered include:

-   Keeping all confidential and proprietary information under lock and
    key (i.e. on-line, subject to computer security measures to prevent
    unauthorized access) and restricting access to such information to
    only those employees who need access to perform their respective
    jobs.
-   Restricting access to certain parts of company offices to authorized
    personnel only;
-   Maintaining a register to be signed by all visitors.
-   Requiring that visitors be escorted while on the premises.
-   Requiring approval of a corporate officer for any office tours and
    restricting the scope of such tours, and
-   Requiring all employees and visitors to wear distinguishing badges,
    especially to gain access to restricted areas.

In addition to internal procedures to maintain the secrecy of all
confidential and proprietary information, there should also be certain
external procedures that will reasonably protect information outside the
company. The single most important external procedure that must be
adopted is the insertion of non-disclosure provisions in all agreements
under which confidential and proprietary information may be disclosed.

Without non-disclosure provisions in all agreements with outsiders (any
non-employees), any information that is disclosed to outsiders could
become public domain information free from any confidentiality
obligation, thus causing complete loss of the protection with regard to
such information. Also, any confidential and proprietary information
disclosed to an outsider should contain a protective statement.

Patents
-------

A patent is a right granted to the owner of an invention that prevents
others from making, using, importing or selling the invention without
his permission. It gives protection to inventions in all fields of human
endeavours and is synonymous with the progress of science and the
creation of useful arts.

### How Is A Patent Registered?

To obtain a patent in Singapore, one must submit a patent application to
the Registry of Patents. The patent application should contain a request
for the grant of a patent, a specification containing a description of
the invention, a claim or claims, any drawing referred to in the
description or any claim and an abstract.

### Benefits Of A Patent

Apart from using the patent to prevent others from exploiting the
invention, the patent owner can exploit his patent in many ways. He can
use his patent to raise funds for his business, license it to third
parties for commercial returns or sell the patented invention for a sum
of money.

### Patentable Inventions

A patentable invention can be a product or a process that gives a new
technical solution to a problem. It can be a new method of doing things,
the composition of a new product, or a technical improvement on how
certain objects work.

For an invention to be patentable, it must, in general, satisfy three
key criteria:

(a) The invention must be **new**
(b) There must be an **inventive step**, and
(c) The invention must be capable of **industrial application**
(d) **The invention must be new:** The invention should not have been
    made known to the public in any way (within or outside of
    Singapore). Owners of inventions should be careful to keep the
    invention secretuntil a patent application has been successfully
    made. An invention is not new if it has already been made available
    to the public orally or by written descrition, or otherwise.

    In certain cases, it may be necessary to disclose the invention
    before the application for a patent is made, e.g. disclosure to a
    marketing consultant. Care must be taken to ensure that the
    disclosure is made in confidence so that such disclosure will not be
    fatal to the subsequent patenting of the invention.

    Once a date of filing has been obtained for the patent application,
    the invention can claim a "Patent Pending" status and the applicant
    can proceed to disclose the invention as indicated in the patent
    application to interested parties. As part of the application
    process, the patent application will be published on the
    Intellectual Property Office of Singapore’s database. This database
    can be viewed by the public.

(e) **There must be an inventive step:** The invention must be something
    that represents an improvement over any existing product or process
    that is already available. If an invention is new yet obvious to a
    person skilled in the art, the invention would not fulfil the
    inventive step requirement.
(f) **The invention must be capable of industrial application:** The
    invention must be useful and have some form of practical
    application. It should be capable of being made or used, or
    achieving a concrete end result in any industry, including
    agriculture.

    It is important to know the state-of-the-art before filing for a
    patent. An inventor would not have to re-invent the wheel and the
    inventor would not infringe on other patents filed or granted. Some
    resources available to help search for existing patents include
    ePatents, SurfIP and the search terminals available at the IPOS'
    Public Search Area. You may also wish to check the databases of
    other countries.

### Non-Patentable Inventions

An invention of a method of treatment of the human or animal body by
surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body
shall not be taken to be capable of industrial application, and hence,
is not patentable.

Also, an invention that is generally expected to encourage offensive,
immoral or anti-social behaviour will not be patentable even if it
satisfies the three key criteria.

### Ownership And Rights

**Legislation Governing Patents**

The Patents Act (Cap. 221) came into force on 23 Feb 1995 and provided
Singapore with its own patent system. The Patents Act and its subsidiary
legislation, which consists of the Patents Rules, the Patents (Patent
Agents) Rules, and the Patents (Composition of Offences) Regulations,
form the legislation governing patent law in Singapore.

Copies of the legislation are available at the Intellectual Property
Office of Singapore website[^21].

**Rights Conferred by a Patent**

For a patent granted in Singapore, the rights conferred by a patent
extend throughout Singapore. It confers on the owner the right to
prevent others from exploiting the invention without his consent during
the term of the patent, which is 20 years from the date of filing the
patent application, subject to the payment of annual renewal fees (i.e
if the annual renewal fee is not paid, then the registered patent
duration will end). Annual renewal fees are payable starting from the
end of the 4th year from the date of filing, and for every subsequent
year thereafter, until the patent expires. If the applicant feels that
the process for application of the patent was unduly delayed, he/she may
request the Registrar to extend the duration of the patent.

Although a patent is a form of intangible property it can be assigned,
licensed or mortgaged or otherwise handled as if it were property.

**Entitlement to a Patent**

The right to the grant of a patent belongs primarily to the inventor or
inventors. However, should the invention be developed in the course of
work, under Singapore law, the rights to the invention may then vest
with the employer. The patent law lays down the circumstances in which
inventions by the employee belong to the employer and those in which
they remain with the employee.

Any person or corporation claiming to be the owner of an invention can
apply for a patent in Singapore. There are no restrictions or
discrimination as to nationality or residency. However, an applicant who
is not a resident in Singapore must provide the Registry of Patents with
an address for service in Singapore to which all correspondences will be
sent. If a patent agent is hired to act on the applicant's behalf, this
address for service should be the practice address of the patent agent.

### Infringement And Enforcement Of Patent Rights

**Infringement**

Infringement occurs when an invention of a patented product or process
is used without the consent of the patent owner while the patent is in
force. For example, the following actions taken without the consent of
the patent owner will constitute infringement:

(a) Where the invention is a product, he makes, disposes of, offers to
    dispose of, uses or imports the product or keeps it whether for
    disposal or otherwise
(b) Where the invention is a process, he uses the process or he offers
    it for use in Singapore when he knows, or it is obvious to a
    reasonable person in the circumstances, that its use without the
    consent of the proprietor would be an infringement of the patent,
    **or**
(c) Where the invention is a process, he disposes of, offers to dispose
    of, uses or imports any product obtained directly by means of that
    process or keeps any such product whether for disposal or otherwise.

**Enforcement**

Where a registered patent has been infringed, the patent owner has the
right to bring civil legal action against the infringer.

The patent owner may seek the following remedies from a court, namely:

(a) An injunction restraining the defendant from any apprehended act of
    infringement.
(b) An order for the defendant to deliver up or destroy any patented
    product in relation to which the patent is infringed or any article
    in which that product is inextricably comprised or any material and
    implement the predominant use of which has been in the creation of
    the infringing product.
(c) For damages in respect of the infringement.
(d) Or an account of the profits derived by him from the infringement,
    and
(e) For a declaration that the patent is valid and has been infringed by
    him.

**Making Unauthorised Claims - A Criminal Offence**

It is a criminal offence to make unauthorised claims about patent rights
or patents applied for. If a party falsely claims his product is
"patented" or "patent pending" or he claims to have applied for a patent
for his product without actually doing so, if found guilty, can face a
fine of up to \$10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12
months or both.

An example of when a person would be deemed to have made an unauthorised
claim that a product is patented, would be where such a product has been
stamped, engraved or impressed on it the word “patent” or “patented” or
anything expressing or implying that the article is a patented product,
shall be taken to represent that the article is a patented product.

Additonally, an example of when a person would be deemed to have made an
unauthorised claim that a product is undergoing patent application would
be where such a product has been stamped, engraved or impressed on it
the word “patent applied for” or “patent pending” or anything expressing
or implying that a patent has been applied for in respect of the
article, shall be taken to represent that a patent has been applied for
in respect of it.

### Hiring Patent Professionals

Although it is not a requirement that a patent application be filed
through an agent, an applicant should consider seeking the advice of a
patent agent for his patent application. Patent applications are
technical requiring legal documents and it is very important that the
patent application is carefully drafted for it to be effective.

A patent agent should be able to advise him on the measures to take in
making any pre-application disclosures, advise on searches on existing
inventions, on the patentability of an invention, attend to the drafting
of the patent application and the prosecution of the patent application
before the Registrar of Patents.

In Singapore, the patent agent profession is regulated by The Patent
(Patent Agents) Rules 2001 and Section 104 and 105 of the Patents Act.
If a person describes himself as a patent agent, he must be registered
with IPOS and have a practising certificate issued by IPOS. The list of
Singapore-based registered patent agents are available at the IPOS
website[^22].

Layout-designs of Integrated Circuits
-------------------------------------

Integrated circuits are integral components in electronic equipment such
as computers and mobile phones. In Singapore, integrated circuits are
now protected under the Layout-Designs of Integrated Circuits Act (Cap.
159A).

A layout-design of an integrated circuit refers essentially to the
three-dimensional character of the elements and interconnections of an
integrated circuit.

An integrated circuit (IC) is an electronic circuit in which the
elements of the circuit are integrated into a medium, and which
functions as a unit. Currently the medium used to create this unit is a
solid semiconductor such as silicon. The circuit is integrated into the
piece of silicon, commonly called a "chip" or a "silicon chip". The
terms "integrated circuit", "semiconductor" and "silicon chip" are used
synonymously as commercial ICs are usually fabricated from silicon
semiconductors.

### Protection

This form of IP need not be registered, but may be protected
nonetheless. A citizen or resident of Singapore, or a country which is a
member of the World Trade Organization, or a country designated by the
Singapore Government as a qualifying country, who owns a layout-design,
can gain automatic protection for the layout-design if it qualifies for
protection under Singapore law. Hence, it is not necessary to file an
application to protect the layout–design or deposit the layout-design
with IPOS.

In Singapore, an original layout-design of an IC can be protected under
the Layout-Designs of Integrated Circuits Act. An original layout-design
is one which is both the result of the creator's own intellectual
effort, and which is not commonplace among creators of layout-designs
and manufacturers of ICs at the time of its creation.

However, where the layout-design is created in pursuance of a
commission, the person who commissioned the layout-design is the owner
and where the layout-design is created by an employee in the course of
his employement, the employer is the owner.

### Duration

A layout-design ceases to be a protected:

(a) If it is first commercially exploited within 5 years after it was
    created, at the end of the tenth calendar year.
(b) In any other case, at the end of the period of 15 calendar years
    after the year in which it was created

### Rights

Section 8 of the Layout-Designs of Integrated Circuits Act provides that
a person who is the owner of the layout-design has the following rights:

a)  To copy, and to authorise the copying of, all or part of his
    protected layout-design, whether by incorporation into an integrated
    circuit or otherwise
b)  To commercially exploit, and to authorise the commercial
    exploitation of, his protected layout-design

### Acts amounting to infringement

A person who does any of the restricted acts referred to in Section 8 of
the Layout-Designs Act as mentioned above, without the consent of the
qualified owner is liable for infringement.

### Acts not amounting to infringement

Instances when acts of a person would not constitute infringement
includes:

a)  If the copying is of any part of a protected layout-design that does
    not comply with the requirement of originality.
b)  If the copying is done for a private purpose and not for commercial
    exploitation.
c)  If the copying is done for the sole purpose of evaluation, analysis,
    research or teaching.
d)  To use the results of such evaluation, analysis or research to
    create a different layout-design that complies with the requirement
    of originality.
e)  To do any of the acts referred to in section 8 (see above) in
    respect of the layout-design referred to in paragraph (d) above
f)  For a qualified owner of another protected layout-design —

<!-- -->

(i) That is identical to the first-mentioned protected layout-design;
    and
(ii) That is independently created,

> to do any of the acts referred to in section 8 (see above) in respect
> of that other layout-design, **or**

a)  To commercially exploit a copy of the protected layout-design, an
    integrated circuit in which the layout-design is incorporated or an
    article that contains an integrated circuit in which the
    layout-design is incorporated after the copy, integrated circuit or
    article has been commercially exploited, whether in Singapore or
    elsewhere, by, or with the consent of, the qualified owner.

### Remedies

The owner can exercise his rights by taking legal action against the
infringing party for damages, injunctions, account of profits, delivery
up and order for disposal.

When damages may be awarded, the court may take into account all of the
circumstances of the case including the flagrancy of the infringement
and any benefit accruing to the defendant by reason of the infringement,
and award additional damages.

Geographical Indications
------------------------

A geographical indication (GI) is a sign that identifies a product as
originating from a specific location which shows that the product has a
special quality or reputation or other characteristic.

Well-known examples of GIs include Darjeeling (tea) and Tuscany (olive
oil).

### Protection

The Geographical Indications Act (Cap. 117B) provides that it is not
necessary to file an application to protect the GI, as it can
automatically be protected under the Geographical Indications Act. It
may also be eligible for registration as a trade mark under the Trade
Marks Act.

A GI informs consumers that a product originates from a certain place
and has special qualities due to that place of origin. On the other
hand, a trade mark is used to distinguish a business’ goods or services
from those of other traders. A GI may be used by all producers or
traders whose products originate from that place and which share typical
characteristics. A trade mark gives its owners the right to prevent
others from using it.

In Singapore, the law protects only the GIs of a country which is a
member of the World Trade Organization, a party to the Paris Convention
for the Protection of Industrial Property, or a country designated by
the Singapore Government as a qualifying country from which GIs of that
country can be protected. Additionally, the GI must be protected in its
country of origin.

### Geographical indications that are not protected

Instances where a GI will not be protected includes the following:

-   It is immoral or against public policy.
-   It has become the common name in Singapore for the goods or services
    which it identifies.
-   It is not or has ceased to be protected in its country of origin, or
    has fallen into disuse in that country, **and**
-   In relation to wines and spirits, it has been used continuously for
    at least 10 years preceding 15 April 1994 or in good faith preceding
    that date.

### Enforcement

In Singapore, a producer of the goods, trader of the goods or an
association of such producers or traders can exercise his rights under
the Geographical Indications Act by taking legal action against the
infringing party when the GI is used in a situation where it is
misleading, unfair, or where the GI used identifies a wine or spirit
that does not originate from the place as indicated by the GI.

Owners of GIs who wish to protect their IP rights must take prompt
action or risked being time-barred. Section 9 of the Geographical
Indications Act provides that no action shall be taken against a person
for the use of a trade mark which contains or consists of a GI after the
expiry of 5 years:

(a) From the date such use by that person or his predecessor in title
    has become generally known in Singapore, **or**
(b) From the date of registration of that trade mark by that person
    under the current Trade Marks Act (Cap. 332) or any previous law
    relating to trade marks, if the trade mark has been published by
    that date, whichever is earlier

The time-bar does not apply where the trade mark in question was used or
registered in bad faith.

Plant Variety
-------------

A plant variety is defined as a plant group within a single botanical
taxon of the lowest rank.

A plant variety can be:

-   Defined by the expression of the characteristics resulting from a
    given genotype or a combination of genotypes.
-   Distinguished from any other plant grouping by the expression of at
    least one of those characteristics, and
-   Considered as a unit with regard to its suitability for being
    propagated unchanged.

If you are a person who breeds plant, and has discovered and developed a
new plant variety, you are called a "breeder" and you can seek
protection for your new plant varieties by applying for a Grant of
Protection for a Plant Variety.

### Protection

The term of protection is 25 years from the date of grant, subject to
the payment of annual fees. Annual fees are payable every year starting
from the end of the first year of grant. The plant variety is your
personal property.

The grant of protection is a right given by the Government to the
breeder to prevent others from doing any of the following acts (Scope of
Grant of Protection) in respect of the propagating material and/or
harvested material of the protected plant variety without the breeder’s
authorisation:

-   Production or reproduction
-   Conditioning for the purpose of propagation
-   Offering for sale
-   Selling or other forms of marketing
-   Export
-   Import, **and**
-   Stocking for any of the purposes mentioned above

The candidate plant variety must meet the following criteria:

(a) **New**
(b) **Distinct**
(c) **Uniform, and**
(d) **Stable**
(e) **New:** The variety has not been sold or disposed of, by or with
    the consent of the breeder:

<!-- -->

i.  Earlier than 1 year before the date of application in Singapore
    where the sale or disposal is made in Singapore, **and**
ii. Where the sale / disposal is made outside of Singapore, earlier than
    6 years before the date of application in the case of trees or
    vines, or earlier than 4 years before the date of application in the
    case of other plant varieties.

<!-- -->

(a) **Distinct:** The variety is clearly distinguishable from any other
    variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge at the time
    of filing of the application. A variety that is of common knowledge
    does not have to be a protected variety.
(b) **Uniform:** The variety is sufficiently uniform in its relevant
    characteristics, subject to the variation that may be expected from
    the particular features of its propagation.
(c) **Stable:** The relevant characteristics of the variety remain
    unchanged after repeated propagation or, in the case of a particular
    cycle of propagation, at the end of each such cycle.

### Denomination

Furthermore, it must also be given a suitable denomination. Thisis the
distinguishing name or identification for the plant variety. The breeder
of the new variety has to propose a suitable denomination as its generic
designation for approval. An example, “Summer Snow” is a denomination
under Rosa in a particular member country of The International
Convention for the Protection of NewVarieties of Plants (“UPOV”). Any
member of the public may access the records at the IPOS Public Search
Room to conduct a search on the denominations in the UPOV Register.

Where an application in a UPOV Convention country has been previously
made for the plant variety, the same denomination has to be used when
applying for the grant of plant variety protection in Singapore.

The proposed denomination has to conform to all the criteria set out in
Sections 36 and 37 of the Plant Varieties Protection Act.

The Registrar shall not approve or register a denomination for the plant
variety which:

-   Consists solely of figures, except where this is an established
    practice for designating plant varieties.
-   Is likely to mislead or cause confusion concerning the
    characteristics, value or identity of the plant variety, or the
    identity of the breeder.
-   Is contrary to any written law or public order, or is likely to be
    offensive to the public
-   Is likely to cause confusion with a trade mark, a name, a business
    or any other rights for which any person other than the applicant
    enjoys protection under any law, **or**
-   Is likely to cause confusion with a trade mark for any material of
    another plant variety or for goods similar to any material of the
    first-mentioned plant variety for which the applicant enjoys
    protection under any law.

### Application for protection

You should apply for plant variety protection at the earliest
opportunity as the system in Singapore operates on a first-to-file
basis. Singapore is a member of the UPOV Convention. Hence if you have a
corresponding application filed earlier in a UPOV Convention member
country , you may claim priority from this first-filed application
within 12 months from the date of the first filing. Similarly, if your
application is first filed in Singapore, it can be used to claim
priority in a corresponding application filed in a UPOV Convention
member country, provided that the corresponding application is filed
within 12 months from the date of the first-filed Singapore application.

Protection for plant varieties is territorial in nature. If you wish to
obtain protection outside of Singapore, you will need to file separate
applications in each of these countries as there is no international
registration system for the filing of an application for a grant of
plant varieties protection.

Although it is not a requirement, an applicant may wish to appoint an
agent to act on his behalf. The Registry recommends that applicants seek
legal advice to determine the scope of their rights.

Applications are administered by the IPOS and the technical examination
will be conducted locally by the Agri-Food Veterinary Authority of
Singapore (AVA). The applicant must file the application form, technical
questionnaire, and necessary supporting documents together with the
prescribed fee, at the Registry of Plant Varieties at IPOS.

All forms are available at the Registry of Plant Varieties and are
downloadable from the IPOS website.

The application may either be submitted in person to the Registry or
mailed to the address below:

| **Registrar of Plant Varieties**
| Registry of Plant Varieties
| Intellectual Property Office of Singapore
| 51 Bras Basah Road
| \#01-01 Manulife Centre
| Singapore 189554
| 

### Publication

The application will be published in the Plant Varieties Protection
Journal, produced by the Registry of Plant Varieties once the
preliminary examination is completed. It is accessible on the IPOS
website.

Challenging the validity of a grant of protection

Anyone can challenge the validity of your grant on the grounds that:

-   The plant was not new or distinct at the time of grant.
-   The plant variety was not uniform or stable at the time of grant,
    **or**
-   The protection has been granted to a party who is not entitled to
    the grant.

Anyone may also apply to the court to challenge the validity of a
registered denomination on the ground that it did not meet the required
registration criteria or the use of the registered denomination by the
grantee has been prohibited or restricted by an order of court pursuant
to any proceedings taken under any law.

Entitlement to plant variety protection

Any breeder, whether an individual or a company, can apply for the grant
of plant variety protection. However, if the plant variety is bred, or
discovered and developed, in the course of work, under Singapore law,
the rights to the plant variety may then vest with the employer.

There are no restrictions or discrimination as to nationality or
residency. However, an applicant who is not a resident in Singapore must
provide the Registry of Plant Varieties with an address for service in
Singapore to which all correspondences will be sent.

### Provisional Protection

Where a grant of protection for a plant variety has been made, the
grantee shall have the right to take proceedings in respect of the
protected variety under the Plant Varieties Protection Act as if the
grant of protection had been made on the date the application for that
grant of protection was published under section 15 of the Plant
Varieties Protection Act.

### Infringement and enforcement

The rights of the owner of the protected plant variety are infringed if
a party performs any of the acts stated in the Scope of Grant of
Protection mentioned above, without the consent of the owner in respect
of the propagating material and/or harvested material of the plant
variety.

The owner of the protected plant variety can take civil legal action
against an infringing party, seek relief in the form of an injunction to
stop the infringing activities, demand for the profits gained by the
infringing party at his expense or seek damages for the loss suffered.
