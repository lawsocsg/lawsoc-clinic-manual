CIVIL CLAIMS (General)
======================

A civil case may be commenced by individuals or legal entities against
other individuals or legal entities in respect of the legal duties and
responsibilities that are owed to each other. If you have a civil case
(for example, a claim for breach of contract, or damage/injury caused by
wrongful acts), the maximum amount of your claim will determine which
court you should commence your claim in.

Jurisdiction of the courts
--------------------------

Civil cases involving claims *not exceeding $60,000* are generally dealt
with by the Magistrate Courts. Civil claims of *more than $60,000 but
not exceeding $250,000* are dealt with by the District Courts. Claims of
*above $250,000* are generally dealt with by the High Court unless the
parties consent to have the claim dealt with in the District Court.

In addition, civil cases (except for motor vehicle accidents or leases
over 2 years) involving certain categories, such as claims not exceeding
$10,000 (or up to $20,000 where both parties consent in writing) may be
brought to a Small Claims Tribunal.

Conducting a Civil Case in Person
----------------------------------

**Basic Information**

A litigant in a civil action (except for Small Claim Tribunal
proceedings) can appoint a lawyer to represent him or conduct his own
case, i.e. act in person. However, a company can only commence or defend
a civil action through a lawyer.

In Small Claims Tribunal proceedings, lawyers are not permitted to
represent the parties. A company should send an employee as a
representative to attend the proceedings. We will discuss proceedings in
the Small Claim Tribunal in Part D below.

**General Considerations**

Litigants in person are held to the same standard of preparation and
conduct as lawyers. They have to comply with all relevant laws and
procedures in the conduct of the case. If a litigant cannot afford to
appoint a lawyer, he may approach the Legal Aid Bureau to determine if
he can qualify for assistance.

This section is intended for litigants representing themselves. It sets
out basic information and court procedures relating to the conduct of a
civil trial in person in the State Courts (i.e. the Magistrate Courts or
District Courts).

For the detailed legal framework, rules, regulations and powers of the
Court in the civil litigation process, litigants may wish to refer to
the following resources which can be found on the website of the State
Courts (*https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/Pages/default.aspx*).

**Service Bureaux**

In the course of a civil case, the parties will have to file, submit and
serve many documents to court and the other parties. Filing and serving
of court documents is usually done electronically by way of the
eLitigation system via the Service Bureaux at either of the following
venues:.

**Commencing a Civil Action**

A civil action is begun by filing an originating process or document in
court. There are 2 types of originating process:

(1) Writ of Summons; or

(2) Originating Summons.

Where there is likely to be substantial factual disputes, a Writ of
Summons should be filed. The Writ of Summons may be filed together with
a Statement of Claim which states the material facts of the case, the
ingredients of the causes of action relied upon and the remedies sought
by the claimant. If the Statement of Claim is not filed together with
the Writ of Summons, it will have to be filed on a later date.

Where a limited application is going to be made to a judge, as provided
by any written law, an Originating Summons should be filed. Equally,
where the sole or principal question is likely to be the construction of
any written law, a deed, a will or contractual document, it is
appropriate to file an Originating Summons.

In this manual, we will focus on civil cases that are commenced by a
Writ of Summons as this is more common.

The party who commences the claim and files a Writ of Summons is known
as the Plaintiff. The other party against whom the claim is made is
known as the Defendant. There can be more than one Plaintiff or
Defendant in any claim.

The Plaintiff should serve the Writ of Summons on the Defendant after
the sealed copy of this document is returned from the Court.

**Defending a Civil Action**

A defendant who wishes to contest the Plaintiff's claim must inform both
the court and the Plaintiff of his intention to do so by entering an
appearance. He must file a Memorandum of Appearance in court *within 8
days* after he is served with the Writ of Summons.

Then, *within 22 days* from the date the Defendant was served with the
Statement of Claim, he must file his Defence in court and serve a copy
of his Defence on the Plaintiff or the Plaintiff's lawyers.

Refusing to acknowledge service of a Writ of Summons does not make the
service of the Writ of Summons invalid. It also does not prevent the
Plaintiff from proceeding further and obtaining a default judgment.

A failure by a Defendant to file the Memorandum of Appearance or to file
and serve his Defence is very serious and may result in default judgment
being entered against him.

If the Defendant has a Counterclaim to make, he may file a Defence &
Counterclaim to set out both his point of defence, as well as his
counterclaim.

The Plaintiff may file a Reply after the Defence has been filed. If the
Defendant had filed a Defence & Counterclaim, the Plaintiff may file a
Reply & Defence to Counterclaim.

The parties’ Statement of Claim, Defence and Reply are known as
“pleadings”.

**Main Stages of a Civil Action before the Trial**

There are several stages between filing the pleadings and the trial
commencing

During the pre-trial stage (known as “interlocutory stage”), both
parties have to comply with the requirements set out in the Rules of
Court, for example, those relating to giving sufficient details of one's
case, the gathering and exchange of documents that are relevant to the
case (known as discovery) and the preparation and exchange of witness
statements by way of Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief.

In the course of preparing the case for trial during the pre-trial
stage, both parties may file interlocutory applications to the court in
order to assist their preparation of their case.

Examples of common interlocutory applications are:

-  Application for default judgment: where a Plaintiff applies for
   judgment without a trial on the ground that the defendant did not
   appear or file and serve his defence;

-  Application for the amendment of documents filed (eg the statement of
   claim, defence, reply) in relation to the matter in dispute;

-  Application for discovery of documents: through this process, the
   court may order a party to disclose certain relevant documents in his
   possession, custody or power to the other party;

-  Application for further and better particulars: through this process,
   the court may order a party to provide further details in his
   pleadings so that the other party can better understand what he needs
   to establish at trial;

-  Application for summary judgment: where the Plaintiff applies for
   judgment without trial on the ground that the defendant has no real
   defence to contest his claim.

-  Application for striking out: where the defendant applies for some
   parts or the whole of the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim to be struck
   out on the basis that there is no reasonable cause of action against
   him, the action is frivolous or vexatious, or an abuse of the process
   of court.

Interlocutory applications may be commenced by filing a Summons,
together with an affidavit to support the application.

The Summons is a document that sets out the parties, the order which the
party wishes to obtain from the court and the grounds of application for
the order. The affidavit is a document that sets out the facts which a
party seeks to rely on in support of his application or to oppose an
application filed by the other party. An affidavit must be attested to
before a Commissioner for Oaths.

**Discovery**

Discovery is a very important process in court proceedings mandated
under Order 24 of the Rules of Court. It requires parties in civil
litigation proceedings to disclose to each other all relevant documents
in their possession, custody or power so that all relevant evidence is
available to the Court.

Parties will have to file a List of Documents in the prescribed format,
listing all relevant documents that are or were in their possession,
custody or power. The parties also have to file an affidavit verifying
the list of documents at the time of the filing. Both the List of
Documents and the affidavit verifying the List of Documents have to be
served on the other parties. After that, the other parties are entitled
to inspect and request a copy of the documents listed in their
opponent’s List of Documents.

Documents that are subject to privilege need not be disclosed.

A party’s obligation to disclose relevant documents is not restricted to
the time during the discovery process, each party being obliged to
continue to disclose all relevant documents from the start until the
conclusion of a civil action.

**Setting Down an Action for Trial**

This is a necessary step usually undertaken by the plaintiff before an
action goes to trial. Please refer to Order 34 of the Rules of Court for
the detailed requirements and procedure to set an action down for trial.

**Pre-Trial Conference**

Once a matter has been set down for trial, a pre-trial conference will
be conducted to ascertain the status of the action and fix the date(s)
of the trial. When attending the pre-trial conference, you should come
prepared to take trial dates and to inform the judge of the number of
witnesses you would like to call and the estimated number of days the
trial will take. As such you should check with your witnesses’ to ensure
they are available. The trial will generally be fixed within 28 days
from the date of the pre-trial conference. If you or any of your
witnesses cannot speak English, this should be made known to the judge
hearing the pre-trial conference.

**Preparing for Trial**

You must make sure that all your witnesses will attend the trial. If you
are not sure whether the witness is will attend, you should apply for a
subpoena to compel his/her attendance.

Prior Trial Documents should be submitted no less than 5 days prior
commencement of an action.

(a) *Affidavits of evidence-in-chief and Bundle of documents* - Each
party must submit to court the originals of the affidavit of
evidence-in-chief of all the witnesses and a bundle of the main
documents that will be relied on or referred to at the trial by any
party. As far as possible, a common bundle of core documents should be
agreed on between the parties and filed by the plaintiff.

(b) *Opening statement* - Opening statements are required in all cases
except where the trial judge has dispensed with the requirement and in
motor vehicle running down actions. The opening statement should set out
the party's case in a nutshell, both on the facts and law.

(b) *Bundle of authorities* - To improve the conduct of civil
proceedings and reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in
court, parties are also required to prepare a bundle of legal
authorities which should accompany the opening statement. Legal
authorities include cases, statutes, subsidiary legislation and any
other reference materials that a party seeks to rely upon.

Besides submitting the above documents to Court, the documents should
also be served on the other party. The detailed contents and format for
the submission of the above documents can be found in paragraph 50 of
the State Courts Practice Directions.

**Documents to Bring on the Day of the Trial**

You must ensure that you have brought two sets of all the documents
submitted above to court: one for the witness and one for yourself. You
should also bring sufficient writing material and stationery to take
notes.

**On the Day of the Trial**

You should arrive early to find your way to the right court on time.
Upon arrival, you should inform the court officer of your presence and
confirm that your case is fixed in that particular court.

If you are late or absent, the case may proceed in your absence. Your
action may be dismissed or judgment entered against you

**Court Decorum**

You should be dressed appropriately in court. You should avoid shabby or
scanty dressing.

When the judge enters and leaves the courtroom, you should stand up and
bow as a show of respect for the Judiciary.

You should remain standing whenever you address the Court. You should
address the judge as "Your Honour", the lawyer for the other side as
"Learned Counsel" and the witnesses by their surname, for example, “Mr
Tan” or “Miss Kamala”.

You should not interrupt the judge or the lawyer for the other side when
they are speaking. If you wish to raise a point when it is not your turn
to speak, you should wait for the judge or lawyer for the other side to
finish speaking before you stand up to seek the permission to raise any
further points.

**Order of Proceedings during the Trial**

(a) *Opening Statements* - As the parties' opening statements would have
been submitted to the Court prior to the trial, the Court would usually
order that the opening statements be deemed seen and read. In such
circumstances, parties need not make oral opening submissions, but will
go straight into the examination of witnesses.

(b) *Examination of Witnesses* - In a civil trial, the plaintiff will
present his evidence first by calling his first witness. When the
witness is on the stand, the rest of the witnesses both for the
Plaintiff and Defendant must wait outside the courtroom.

When the Plaintiff's witness is on the stand, the Plaintiff will be
given the first opportunity to ask the witness questions. This is known
as the "examination-in-chief" of the witness. As the evidence sought to
be adduced by each witness would already be contained in the affidavit
of evidence-in- chief, the examination-in-chief of each witness is
generally short. After taking the oath, the witness will usually be
asked to confirm his name, identitification number, occupation and
residential address to establish his identity. After that, he will be
asked to confirm the truth of the contents of his/her Affidavit of
Evidence-in-Chief.

After the examination-in-chief is complete, the Defendant’s lawyer or
the Defendant will be entitled to ask the witness questions. This is
known as cross-examination. This is the opportunity to challenge the
evidence given by the Plaintiff's witness. This can be done by giving
the defendant's version of events to the witness and asking if the
witness agrees. The Defendant can also rely on documentary evidence to
contradict the evidence given by the witness. Questions intended to
insult or embarrass the witness are not allowed. Questions which are not
relevant to the issue at hand can also be objected to by the other
party.

After the cross-examination, the Plaintiff is allowed to ask the witness
some questions to clarify the answers given by the witness during cross
examination. This is known as the re-examination of the witness.

After all the Plaintiff's witnesses have given evidence, the Plaintiff
will inform the court that he has closed his case. The Defendant's
witnesses will then give evidence before the court. The procedure for
the examination of the Defendant's witnesses is the same as that for the
Plaintiff's witnesses.

(c) *Closing Submissions* - After the examination of all the witnesses
of the parties, oral closing submissions by each party will be made,
making reference to the parties final arguments.

Usually, a party's closing submissions will summarise the evidence heard
during the trial and will set out the reasons why the Court should rule
in favour of that party: for example, why the Court should not accept
the evidence of certain witnesses. Closing submissions will also usually
set out the legal authorities supporting the party's arguments, for
example, legislation or previously decided cases.

The Court may decide that parties do not need to make their closing
submissions orally. Instead the Court may give the parties a deadline by
which to file their written closing submissions. Usually the Defendant
will make his closing submissions first, followed by the Plaintiff. It
is also possible for parties to exchange their written submissions
simultaneously.

**Judgment**

The judgment is the decision of the Court at the conclusion of the
trial. The Court may pronounce judgment immediately after listening to
the closing submissions, or may adjourn the case to take more time to
consider the evidence and arguments. In such an instance, the Court will
inform the parties onto attend the Court at a later date for the
delivery of judgment.

Once judgment is given, that party should not argue with the judge or
protest in any other way as this may amount to contempt of court.

**Appeal**

If a party is not satisfied with the judgment, he should file a notice
of appeal within 14 days from the pronouncement of the judgment. Before
filing and appeal, the party should check and apply for leave to appeal
if required.

Other FORUMS
------------

**Small Claims Tribunals**

The Small Claims Tribunals provides a quick and inexpensive forum for
the resolution of small claims between consumers and suppliers that
arose less than a year ago. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear
certain categories of claims and claims not exceeding $10,000 (or not
exceeding $20,000 if parties consent in writing). 

Generally, claims arising from any of the following matters may *not* be
heard in the Small Claims Tribunals:

-  Hire purchase agreement

-  Employment matters

-  Loans

-  Purchase of stocks and shares

-  Rental (except the lease of a residential property for a period not
   exceeding 2 years) or charters

-  Legal fees

-  Co-broking

-  Insurance claim

-  Damage caused by use of a motor vehicle

Falling within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal are:

-  A contract for sale of goods

-  A contract for a provision of services (note: services should involve
   skill and labor)

-  Damage caused to property

-  A contract for a lease of residential property which does not exceed
   2 years

-  Cancellation of contracts under the Consumer Fair Trading
   (Cancellation of contracts) Regulations 2009

-  Refund of motor vehicle deposits with the Consumer Fair Trading
   (Motor Vehicle Dealer Deposits) Regulations 2007

-  Opt-out under Consumer Fair Trading (Out-Out) Regulations 2007

A monetary claim that is split or divided into several claims so as to
bring it within the Tribunals' jurisdiction is not allowed.

The Claimant has to file a Claim Form. The other party against whom the
claim is served is known as the Respondent. Lawyers may not represent
parties at Small Claims Tribunals’ hearings.

Both parties will be required to attend a Consultation before the
Registrar who will attempt to mediate the dispute first. If the claim
cannot be resolved at Consultation, the matter will be fixed for Hearing
on another day before a Referee. After hearing both sides of the
dispute, the Referee will decide the case and make an appropriate Order,
which will be binding on both parties.

The Order of Tribunals will either demand a sum to be paid or for work
to be done.Payment of a summust generally occur within a specified
time-frame. Failure to do so can result in an enforcement Order by Writ
of Seizure and Sale.

An appeal against a Referee’s decision will be heard by the High Court
and can only be made on a question of law or jurisdiction.

Situations where claims can arise
---------------------------------

Consumer protection – Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (“CPFTA”)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPFTA provides the legislative framework to allow consumers
aggrieved by unfair retail practices to have recourse to a civil claim
in the Courts or the Small Claims Tribunals (subject to their
jurisdictional limits).

**Purpose of the CPFTA**

The CPFTA aims to stamp out unconscionable conduct of businesses.
Consumers are protected in two broad scenarios, namely:

(1) Where the supplier of goods uses unfair practices to induce the
    consumer. This could include misrepresentation, or an omission to
    state important information.

(2) Where the supplier of goods provides goods that do not conform to
    the applicable contract (faulty goods).

In each of these scenarios the CPFTA entitles a consumer to seek
remedies from a court.

For unfair practices a consumer can make a claim for damages so long as
the amount does not exceed $30,000. The consumer may also choose to
pursue a claim concurrently to the CPFTA and abandon the claim for any
amount that is in excess of the prescribed limit.

An alternative remedy available under the CPFTA is an injunction or
declaration from a court that can prohibit the supplier from continuing
to carry out the unfair practice.

For the supply of goods that do not conform to the contract, the
supplier is given a reasonable time to fix or replace the goods. If the
supplier fails to complythe consumer can seek assistance from the court
for specific performance of the supplier’s obligations. Specific
performance is a discretionary remedy that allows the court to compel
the to carry out a particular course of action. Failure to comply with
this order will amount to contempt of court. As an alternative to fixing
or replacing the goods, the supplier may reduce the amount to be paid
for the goods or rescind the contract for the sale of the goods.

Regulated contracts are the subject of further requirements under the
Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) (Cancellation of Contracts)
Regulations 2009 (“**Cancellation of Contract Regulations**\ ”). A
“regulated contract” refers to a direct sales contract, a long-term
holiday product contract, a time share contract or a time share related
contract.

The consumer must bring his/her claim within two years of either the
last material date of the transaction. or from the time that the
consumer had knowledge of the unfair practice committed by the supplier.

Mediation by Consumers Assocation of Singapore (CASE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have a dispute with a retailer over consumer goods and services
which you have not been able to resolve, you can approach CASE for
advice and assistance. CASE handles consumer-to-business disputes.

In a mediation, you will have full opportunity to put forward your side
of the story. You should therefore provide full details of the unfair
practice in chronological order. You may find it useful to write down
the details and practice discussing them with a friend before the
mediation.

Limitation of actions
---------------------

This principle bars a person from initiating legal action after a
certain amount of time has elapsed since their claim first arose.

This principle aims to:

(1) Protect unsuspecting defendants against being served claims years
    after the wrong occurred, and:

(2) Ensure that legal actions are tried by the Courts in a timely
    manner.

**What are the time limits to bring legal actions?**

Generally, a legal action based on a contract or a tort (civil wrong)
must be brought within six years from the cause of action arising. For
cases involving negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, the time limits
are:

(1) Within three years of the date the cause of action arising, or;

(2) Within three years from the date the plaintiff had knowledge of the
    right to take the legal action.

**What happens if the time period lapses?**

| If person does not intiate their legal action within the prescribed
  time limits their action will be time barred, meaning that their legal
  rights are extinguished.
| Personal Injuries Claims

**What is a personal injury?**

A personal injury can include, for example, an injury at work or in a
traffic accident, received as a result of faulty goods or services,
sustained by tripping over paving stones, or caused by errors in
hospital treatment.

If you have sustained a personal injury you may want to consider the
following:

(1) Do you want to make a complaint to the person or organisation you
    believe was responsible for the injuries:

(2) Do you want to make a claim for compensation to cover losses you
    have suffered as a result of the injury;

(3) Are there any immediate financial problems arising because of the
    injury, for example, you are unable to work.

**Action to be taken**

Whatever you are intending to do about your personal injury, actions
could include:

(1) If the injury resulted from a road accident, lodging a police report
    and reporting it to your insurance company.

(2) If the injury resulted from an accident at work, you should notify
    your employer and the accident must be recorded in the accident
    book.

(3) Reporting the injury to your doctor because it could become more
    serious. You should do this even if the injury seems minor. If you
    subsequently go to Court to get compensation for the injury, the
    doctor will be asked to provide a medical report.

(4) Gathering evidence about the accident and injuries. For example, it
    may be useful to take photographs of the scene of an accident and
    the cause of injury. You should also, if possible, write an account
    of the incident while details are still fresh in your mind. If there
    are witnesses, you should make a note of their names and addresses.

(5) Keeping copies of all relevant documents (eg. Receipts and medical
    reports).

**Making a complaint**

If you have had an accident or suffered an injury you might be able to
get an explanation of what went wrong and to receive an apology. In some
cases, there may be an official complaints procedure, however these may
be very time consuming and may only result in an apology.If you have
suffered a personal injury and you also want compensation, you should be
aware that there are time limits for taking legal action and going
through a complaints procedure may sometimes delay matters.

**Compensation**

The main way of getting compensation for a personal injury is by taking
legal action in a civil court.

If you have sustained a personal injury you may be able to claim two
types of compensation, general damages and special damages.

General damages are paid as compensation for an injury, for example, a
payment for pain and suffering or loss of future earnings. The court
will decide on the amount to be paid.

Special damages are paid as compensation for actual financial loss
caused by the accident up to the date of the hearing. These can include
damage to clothing or other belongings, the costs of care, travel costs
to hospital, medical expenses (including the cost of private treatment)
and the cost of hiring and/or repairing a car if it has been damaged in
the accident.

If a court decides that you were partly to blame for the accident, it
may reduce the amount of damages you receive. An example of this would
be if you were not wearing a seat belt when you were involved in a
traffic accident.

**Taking legal action**

If you want to take legal action to claim compensation for a personal
injury you will need to get advice from a solicitor. This must be done
as soon as possible as there are strict time limits

**Time limits**

There are different time limits within which you must begin legal action
in a personal injury claim. The most common claim in a personal injury
case is negligence and the time limit for this is 3 years from when the
injury arose.

**Costs**

On top of compensation (also reffered to as damages), a party may be
awarded costs.

There are two types of costs: party-party costs and solicitor-client
costs. Party-party costs refers to a sum of money which the court may
order a party to an action (not always necessarily the winner) to pay to
the other party to help offset that party’s legal fees (i.e.
solicitor-client costs). The rationale behind this is that the ‘loser’
should be made to pay a portion of the ‘winner’s’ legal fees in having
to commence the action in the first place.

The quantification of costs will be decided by the Courts, having regard
to the conduct of both the parties. There may be instances where the
‘winner’ of the action is ordered to pay a huge amount of party-party
costs to the ‘loser’ despite the judgment being in his favour. This is
often the case when the court is of the view that the litigation may not
have to take on such a protracted course and that the ‘winner’ had not
conducted the litigation in good faith. In such situations, the ‘winner’
may ultimately end up being the ‘loser’ as the costs he has to pay to
the other side will be greater than the damages he was awarded.

It is a fundamental principle that party-party costs should never be
allowed to exceed solicitor-client costs. This means that each party to
an action will never be able to claim costs to completely offset their
own legal fees. There appears to be a widely-held view that a ‘winner’
of a lawsuit never has to pay for their legal fees and the court will
invariably order the ‘loser’ to pay all the legal costs that the
‘winner’ has incurred. As explained above, this is unfortunately (or
fortunately as the case may be) a misconception.

Traffic Accidents
-----------------

As of 1 June 2008, the Motor Claims Framework (‘MCF’), which is meant to
be ‘clear and common procedures’ laid down by the General Insurance
Association of Singapore will come into effect. Motorists must follow
these procedures in case of an accident. The MCF will also assist
vehicle owners to obtain ‘speedy and professional repairs’. Vehicle
owners will not incur any fees or charges in the reporting process.

What to do at the accident site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should take down the following particulars:

(1) registration numbers and name of insurance companies of all vehicles
    involved in the accident;

(2) names, NRIC Numbers, addresses and telephone numbers of the drivers,
    passengers, injured pedestrians and witnesses.

| You should also give your particulars to the other parties involved in
  the accident.
| If it is a serious accident e.g. where someone is injured or has died,
  call the police. As the police need to draw a sketch plan, do not move
  the vehicles or dead bodies.
| If possible,

(1) make a sketch plan or mental note of the accident site, position of
    vehicles, any landmarks; and

(2) take photographs of all damage caused by the accident. You must keep
    the negatives of those photographs.

This is important. Many do not realise how essential and helpful sketch
plans, photographs of the scene of the accident and photographs of
damage sustained are to parties who are trying to resolve the accident
claim, be it pre or post writ.

**Note:** Should you, as a vehicle owner, fail to report to your
insurers, then you may find yourself prejudiced meaning that your
insurers will have the right to reject your claim. This may also result
in a loss of your No Claim Discount when you review your policy next.

What to do immediately after the accident
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Police report**

You should make a written police report as soon as possible at any
police station or Neighbourhood Police Post. If you are hospitalised
as a result of the accident, make your report as soon as you are
discharged from hospital. Give all the information mentioned above in
“what to do at the accident site”.

The report must be made in English. If you have difficulty, ask
someone to help you write a report beforehand or you can explain the
accident to the police officer who will translate it into English and
write it for you. The police report is important because it is the
official written record of the accident. Your insurance company, the
police and lawyers will refer to it if you make any claim for
compensation.

**Report to insurance company**

You should report the accident to your insurance company
(“insurers”) within the time limit stated in your policy, usually 7
days, otherwise your insurers may not accept responsibility for any
claims made by you or any third party claims against you.

**Damage to your vehicle**

You should arrange for your damaged vehicle to be removed to your
workshop or to a workshop approved by your insurer for a survey and
repairs. If, however, you wish to claim against the insurer of the other
vehicle, you may wish to give the other vehicle’s insurer an opportunity
to inspect your vehicle within a reasonable time (e.g. 48 hours).

**Personal injury**

If you have been injured, see a doctor immediately and get a medical
report. Depending upon the severity of the accident and how it
physically impacted you, this could be the most important step and
should occur first.

**Keeping records**

You should keep a proper record of the following:

(1) particulars of the accident;

(2) copies of police reports/GIA reports;

(3) medical and specialist reports;

(4) a list of expenses incurred, e.g. transport, medical fees and rental
    of car; and

(5) documents supporting your claim such as photographs (and negatives),
    medical certificates, repair bills and receipts.

(6) names and particulars of witnesses.

Making a claim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Claim against your own insurance company**

In this case, you should note that there is an excess clause in your
insurance policy. Your claim must exceed the excess amount, and your
insurance company will only pay the difference between your claim and
the excess amount. For example, if the excess amount is $700 and your
claim is $500 the insurers will not pay out at all. However, if your
claim is $1,000, your insurers will only pay $300. You will also lose
your no claim bonus.

**Claim against another person**

It is advisable to see a lawyer. Please remember that lawyers can
represent you only if you authorise them to do so, usually by signing a
warrant to act. Please be informed that vehicle workshops are not
authorised to make claims on your behalf.

**Claiming in hit and run cases**

If you suffer personal injuries as a result of an accident and do not
know the particulars of the other party that caused the accident, you
may make a claim to the Motor Insurance Bureau.

**FIDReC Non-Injury Motor Accident (NIMA) Scheme**

From March 2008, the FIDReC Non-Injury Motor Accident Scheme
("FIDReC-NIMA Scheme") helps consumers resolve non-injury motor accident
disputes with insurance companies in which the amount claimed is below
$1,000. The Scheme covers claims by consumers against an insurance
company which is **not** their own insurer.

**Police summons**

If you receive a police summons charging you of an offence related to
the accident, you should seek advice from a lawyer immediately before
taking any course of action. Note that if you plead guilty, accept a
warning or pay the summons, it can be used against you at a civil
hearing of the same case. It is therefore highly advisable that you
engage a lawyer as soon as possible to advise you on the appropriate
steps to take as well as the legal implications that may arise in your
case.

What to Do If a Claim is Made Against Me
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Report to your insurers**

The moment you are involved in an accident report to your insurers
within 24 hours or by the next working day.

If you receive a Letter of Demand from the lawyers of the other vehicle
in the accident or a Writ of Summons, you should inform your insurers
immediately. The Letter of Demand will contain a paragraph telling you
to forward the claim together with the supporting documents to your
insurers.

In the event that a Writ of Summons is served on you personally, you
should immediately inform your insurers so that they can handle the
matter for you themselves or appoint lawyers on your behalf to do so. It
is important to remember that within 8 days of the Writ of Summons being
served on you, a Memorandum of Appearance (a Court document) must be
filed in Court, failing which, either a Final Judgment or Interlocutory
Judgment can be entered against you.

It is imperative to be mindful of these matters to avoid incurring or
escalating costs for yourself.

If your insurers repudiate liability for whatever reason, then you may
want to engage your own lawyer to handle your case. You will bear the
costs in such a case. One common reason for repudiation is if you were
driving under the influence of alcohol.

**Non-Injury Motor Claims**

The law allows you 6 years to claim for any damage to your vehicle.

Under the Non-Injury Motor Accidents (‘NIMA’) protocol, non-injury motor
claims will most probably proceed for mediation at the Primary Dispute
Resolution Centre (commonly called the ‘PDRC’). It is presided by a
District Judge in a mediation chamber. The PDRC will consider the GIA
reports of the parties involved in the accident and any other relevant
evidence in order to determine the liability of the parties. Sometimes
the Court will direct the parties to appear in person. The District
Judge will then give an indication of the liability of the parties, who
have the prerogative of accepting or rejecting the Court’s indication.

In the event that both parties accept the indication, they can proceed
to settle or negotiate the quantum. Most, if not all insurers, will take
away your No Claim Discount (‘NCD’) if the indication against you
exceeds 20%. This is the general policy but of course the prerogative
and final decision lies with your insurers.

However if you do not accept the indication of the Court, you must be
prepared to proceed to trial. If this is against the advice of your
insurers, you will have to bear the costs yourself if you lose the case.

**Personal injury cases**

A personal injury claim must be brought within 3 years, after which his
claim will be time-barred.

Like the NIMA cases for property damage, the personal injury claims will
proceed for mediation for parties to resolve the issue of liability
first. In the event that it is settled at PDRC, the parties will proceed
to resolve quantum either at a mediation session called the ‘ADCR’,
where an indication on quantum will be given by the presiding District
Judge or if not settled, proceed for an Assessment of Damages hearing
(‘AD’). The AD is like a trial but the Court will only decide on
quantum.

One has to bear in mind that costs continue to escalate the further one
proceeds. Therefore one must consider the practicalities and the cost
consequences of any case.

**Seeing Your Lawyer**

When you see your lawyer, bring along the documents noted in the
paragraph on ‘Keeping Records’.

Your lawyer will:

(1) go through the documents and consider the evidence;

(2) take a statement from you and advise you on the strength of your
    case;

(3) write letters on your behalf to claim compensation;

(4) discuss with you offers made and negotiate a settlement; and

(5) if a settlement is not made, start proceedings in Court, prepare
    court documents, interview your witnesses and prepare for trial.

What Can a Person Claim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**General damages**

This compensates you for pain and suffering as a result of injuries
caused to your person (‘personal injuries’). There are some guidelines
from earlier cases.

**Special damages**

This compensates you for expenses incurred, eg costs of medical fees,
transport, repairs to vehicle, hiring another vehicle while your vehicle
is being repaired, loss of salary, any other actual expenses incurred
and CPF savings contributions before the trial. You must make sure that
you keep the original receipts for these expenses. At times, the court
may decide that you are partially to blame for the accident, i.e. are
"contributorily negligent". If so, your claim will be reduced by the
percentage the court finds you liable.

**Bereavement**

When it is a fatal accident, the Civil Law Act [Cap 43] entitles those
listed under section 21(2) to claim for bereavement. This includes
children, parents of the deceased and so forth. It is fixed at
$10,000.00. It is not a claim of $10,000.00 per claimant, as this amount
is to be divided among the number of claimants notwithstanding how many
there are.

**At the Trial**

| If your claim is under $250,000.00 your action should commence in the
  State Courts. Any amount above that is within the jurisdiction of the
  High Court.
| If proceedings are commenced in Court, there are two questions to be
  decided:

(1) Liability, ie who is responsible; and

(2) Quantum, ie how much the damage caused is worth (see ‘What Can a
    Person Claim’)

For liability, the Court can decide that one party is fully responsible
for the accident, in which case, he is said to be ‘100% liable’. The
Court can also decide that the person making the claim (plaintiff) is
partly responsible for the accident (contributory negligent).

The Court will assess the degree of responsibility in percentage terms
and divide the damage accordingly, eg if the plaintiff is found to be
20% contributorily negligent for a $10,000 claim, then he will only be
awarded the sum of $8,000 as damages.

**Costs**

The costs you have to pay your lawyer is called ‘Solicitor and Client’
costs. The costs that the losing party pays to the winning party is
called ‘Party and Party’ costs.

If you lose your case, normally you will have to pay the other side’s
Party and Party costs, as well as your own Solicitor and Client costs.
If you win your case, the Party and Party costs received by you can be
used towards paying your own Solicitor and Client costs which may be
more than your Party and Party costs.

If you are awarded a sum of $5,000 or more for personal injuries, a
Public Trustee fee of $500 is incurred. This is usually paid by the
Defendant as part of the entire settlement of the Plaintiff’s claim.

**Note:** Under the MCF, all accidents, regardless of how minor, and
even if the damage is not visible, must be reported to your insurers
within 24 hours or by the next working day. Even if you intend to claim
from the insurers or Third Parties you must still lodge a report with
your insurers. With this new policy, all insurers will operate a 24-hour
hotline.

The Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Singapore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[The information in this section is taken from the General Insurance
Assocation’s website at http://www.gia.org.sg]

**1. What is the scope of the MIB’s work?**

The Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB) is an independent body that was set up
by insurers in 1975 and is funded by all motor insurers in Singapore.
The MIB provides cover for personal injury claims only, in accordance
with the Untraced Drivers' Agreement and the Uninsured Drivers'
Agreement between the Government, the MIB and general insurance
companies. The Untraced Drivers' Agreement requires the MIB to consider
compensation for victims of 'hit and run' accidents where the motor
vehicle is untraced. The Uninsured Drivers' Agreement requires the MIB
to meet unsatisfied Court Judgments against identified motorists who may
have been uninsured.

**2. In what circumstances should I approach the MIB?**

You should only approach the MIB after you have made reasonable
enquiries to determine if the motorist who has caused the accident is
untraced or uninsured. Those enquires will include but not necessarily
be limited to contacting the uninsured motorist, the Traffic Police to
confirm if the accident has been reported, and obtaining details of the
registration of the vehicle from the Land Transport Authority.
Applications must be submitted in writing, within three years from the
date of the accident.

**3. What will happen when I contact the MIB?**

For accidents caused by an untraced motorist, the MIB will require you
or your solicitors to complete an application form to explain what
happened, give details of your injuries and an authority to obtain
evidence from others such as your doctor and employer.

Where an uninsured motorist is involved, you may be required to obtain a
judgment against the uninsured motorist.

**4. How do I contact the MIB?**

You can call the MIB on 6220 8607 or visit the office at 112 Robinson
Road #05-03 HB Robinson, Singapore 068902. MIB staff will provide you
with the necessary forms and assistance to lodge your application.

**5. What happens after I have completed and returned the application
forms?**

The MIB will acknowledge receipt and explain what action is being taken.
The action will vary depending on the facts and the information you have
been able to provide. The MIB will conduct an investigation based on
this information.

**6. What form will the investigation take?**

External parties will undertake the investigation work for the MIB. They
may interview you and obtain a full statement about the accident and
your injuries. The scene of the accident may be visited, a plan prepared
and witnesses may be interviewed. Medical evidence may be obtained and
if you have any loss of earnings, evidence may be taken from your
employer.

**7. How long will my claim take?**

This is difficult to predict as many different factors are involved. It
may be necessary to wait until investigations are completed. MIB will
make every effort to reach a decision on responsibility as quickly as
possible.

**8. What happens when investigations have been completed?**

Responsibility for the accident has to be agreed on or decided by the
Council of the MIB or by a Court. Your claim may be reduced or rejected,
if the evidence shows that you were partly or completely at fault.

**9. Who pays for the MIB?**

The MIB is funded by all motor insurers in Singapore. Motor insurers are
required by the Government to pay a share of the MIB’s costs. Members
pay their share by way of subscription, which is a proportion of their
motor business for the previous year.

**10. How much compensation does MIB pay?**

The MIB, in its first year of operation in 1975, paid compensation
totalling $14,100 for five claims. In 2004, the MIB paid 21 claims
amounting to $163,040. From 1975 to 2004 the MIB had paid a total of 851
claims amounting to $25.3 million. Currently, there are 137 outstanding
claims with an estimated value of $4.3 million.

**11. How is the MIB Administered?**

The MIB Council, which is comprised of representatives from the leading
motor insurers and the Government, assesses all claims and determines
their validity.

**12. What can I do if I think I have grounds for complaint?**

The MIB deals with all claims in accordance with service standards.
However, if you are dissatisfied, please write to the MIB through your
solicitor. MIB will then forward your appeal to the Public Trustee,
whose decision is final.

**What is CaseTrust-SVTA Accreditation for Motoring Business?**

Since December 2007 the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association (SVTA)
work on the new accreditation scheme. From the complaints gathered from
consumers who have had trouble with car dealers, CASE was able to
identify the most common errant practices that vehicle dealers have used
against consumers. This accreditation scheme was designed in a bid to
differentiate the trustworthy vehicle dealers who offer transparency and
good business practices in their dealings with consumers.

Model agreements were designed to be used by accredited vehicle dealers
to add greater transparency to the process of purchasing a motor
vehicle. These 4 contracts would clearly spell out the liabilities of
each party, as well as the terms and conditions with regards to the
purchase of a motor vehicle.

**What can consumers expect from a CaseTrust-SVTA Accredited business?**

A motoring business that achieves CaseTrust-SVTA accreditation is
certified as a business that possesses the foundation for good sales
practices and standards. The business will have the following mechanisms
in place:

**Clear Fee Policies**

Clearly articulated and documented policies on fees and fee refunds.
These must be fully disclosed to customers and adher to the terms and
conditions of the contract between the business and consumers.

**Well-Defined Business Practices and Systems**

A redress system with proper and clearly defined dispute resolution
mechanisms for the business and consumers. This will include mediation
by the Motor Industry Dispute Resolution Centre (MIDReC), CASE Mediation
Centre, and recourse to the Small Claims Tribunals and the Courts, if
necessary.

An insurance bond capped at $50,000 protects the customer’s fees and
deposits paid in the event of an unresolved dispute.

**Well-Trained Personnel**

The business must ensure that it has trained sales staff who do not
practice unethical sales tactics and are able to provide good customer
service.

**What is the insurance bond for?**

All accredited motoring businesses will be required to purchase an
insurance bond in the amount of $50,000. The insurance bond is one of
the many ways that an accredited motoring business shows its commitment
to their customers.

In the event that a consumer has an unresolved dispute with an
accredited motoring business the matter can be referred to MIDReC, where
an adjudicator or panel of adjudicators will decide on the facts and
merits of each case. If the decision is made in favour of the consumer,
a payout will be made from this insurance bond.

Motor Industry Dispute Resolution Centre
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MIDReC is an independent and impartial institution specializing in the
resolution of disputes between motoring businesses and consumers.
Consumers who have an unresolved dispute with an accredited motoring
business can lodge their claim/dispute with MIDReC.

**What is MIDReC’s Dispute Resolution Process?**

The dispute resolution process of MIDReC comprises of Mediation (1st
Stage) and Adjudication (2nd Stage).

**Mediation (1st Stage)**

When a complaint is first received, it is handled by MIDReC’s Case
Manager. The complainant and the accredited business are encouraged to
resolve the claim/dispute in an amicable and fair manner. In appropriate
cases, the Case Manger mediates the dispute between parties.

**Adjudication (2nd Stage)**

Where the dispute is not settled by mediation, the case is heard and
adjudicated by a MIDReC Adjudicator or a Panel of Adjudicators.
Accredited businesses are contractually bound to honour the decisions
made by MIDReC.

**When should I approach MIDReC?**

Consumers can approach MIDReC or CASE Mediation Centre when they have a
dispute with a CaseTrust-SVTA accredited business that they have not
been able to resolve or has not been resolved to their satisfaction.

**How do I file a complaint with MIDReC?**

Consumers can file a complaint by submitting a complaint resolution form
together with a registration fee of $30 at MIDReC either in person or
via fax, post, or email.

**What happens after I file a complaint with MIDReC?**

On receipt of the complaint, a Case Manger will process the claim. If
the claim is within MIDReC’s jurisdiction, the Case Manager will take it
up with the accredited business concerned and facilitate a resolution of
the dispute if possible through case management and mediation.

**What if a settlement cannot be reached during mediation?**

If a resolution cannot be reached, the consumer may then choose to take
his or her complaint further by referring the dispute/claim to the
Adjudicator or Panel of Adjudicators for adjudication.

**How long will it take for MIDReC to resolve my dispute?**

The length of time needed varies with the complexity of each case.
MIDReC will seek to resolve all disputes as expeditiously as possible.

Insurance Bond against Mischief
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All accredited motoring businesses will be required to purchase an
insurance bond in the amount of $50,000. The insurance bond is one of
the many ways that an accredited motoring business takes to show its
commitment to their customers.

(Is this the same as the insurance bond referred to on p.50?)

**How does this insurance bond work?**

In the event a consumer has an unresolved dispute with an accredited
motoring business the dispute can be referred to MIDReC where an
Adjudicator or Panel of Adjudicators will decide based on the facts and
merits of each case. When a decision is made in favour of the consumer,
a payout will be made from this insurance bond.

**Is there a minimum or maximum amount that I can claim?**

There is no minimum amount that can be claimed. The maximum amount of
the claim is S$50,000.

**Under what circumstances will this payout be made?**

A payout will be made when a decision by the Adjudicator or Panel of
Adjudicators is in favour of the consumer and is monetary in nature.

**Are consumers bound by the judgement passed at adjudication?**

The decision of the Adjudicator or panel of Adjudicators is final and
binding on the accredited business concerned, but not on the consumer.
If the consumer is unhappy with the decision, he/she is free to reject
the it and pursue a claim through other avenues. This essentially means
that there is no disadvantage for consumers if they choose to lodge
their complaint/claim with MIDReC.

**What happens when there are other claims against the company that
exceeds S$50,000?**

Once the number of registered claims against a particular motor vehicle
dealer equals to or exceeds S$50,000, the amount will be shared on an
equal basis in accordance with the ratio of the amount of each claim.

Employment Act
--------------

The Employment Act covers every employee (regardless of nationality) who
is under a *contract of service* with an employer. It does not make any
distinction between a temporary employee, contract employee, daily-rated
employee or employee on tenured employment.

Employees working less than 35 hours a week are covered by the
Employment of Part-Time Employees Regulations, which provides certain
flexibility for both the employers and employees, including the
pro-rating of employment benefits, encashment of annual leave and
provision of rest day.

**Managers and executives**

Managers and executives are employees with executive or supervisory
functions. These functions include the authority to influence or make
decision on issues such as recruitment, discipline, termination of
employment, assessment of performance and reward,involvement in the
formulation of strategies and policies of the enterprise, or the
management and running of the business.

They also include professionals with tertiary education and specialised
knowledge/skills and whose employment terms are comparable to those of
managers and executives. Professionals such as lawyers, accountants,
dentists and doctors whose nature and terms of employment are comparable
to executives are deemed as such, , are therefore not covered by the
ActJunior managers and executives earning $4,500 basic monthly salary
and below are considered employees under the Employment Act to the
extent of all provisions apart from the provisions of part IV –
concerning rest days, hours of work and other conditions of service.

Part IV of the Act, which provides for rest days, hours of work,
holidays and other conditions of service, applies only to:

a) Workmen earning not more than $4,500 basic monthly salaries, and

b) Employees who earn basic monthly salaries not exceeding $2,500 a
month.

**Rights as an Employee**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Salary**

Your salary must be paid at least once a month (not necessarily on the
first day of a calendar month) and within the 7 days of the end of each
salary period. For example, if your salary period ends on the 15th day
of each calendar month, you must be paid no later than the 22nd day of
the month.

If your employer ends your contract of service, you should be paid
within 3 days of the end of your employment. If you end your employment,
you should be paid within 7 days of the end of your employment.

Your employer can make deductions from your salary for a number of
reasons, for example:

(1) Absence from work without good reason;

(2) Repayment of a loan;

(3) Income tax;

(4) CPF contributions;

(5) The costs of goods entrusted to you which are lost or damaged
    because of your negligence;

(6) If you agree, for meals supplied by the employer, and;

(7) If you agree, for housing accommodation supplied by the employer.

There are limits to the deductions which can be made and the total
amount of such deductions cannot be more than half your monthly salary.
Regarding housing accommodation there is a further provision that no
more than 25% of your monthly salary be deducted.

In addition to your salary, you may also get extra allowances, for
example, for food or accommodation, but not for alcohol or drugs.

Your employer cannot tell you how you should spend your salary, for
example, if he sets up a canteen at your place of work, he cannot force
you to buy your meals there.

All salary must be paid in legal tender and be paid into your personal,
joint account or by cheque to you.

If your employer does not comply with payment of salary on time, payment
of salary in dismissal or payment of salary on termination by employee,
he is guilty of an offence and can be fined between $3,000 - $15,000
and/or jailed up to 6 months, and for a subsequent offence fined up to
$6000 - $30,000 and/or jailed up to 12 months.

**Conditions of Work**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following matters are only applicable to employees if your monthly
income does not exceed $2,500 a month, and for workmen whose monthly
salary does not exceed $4,500 a month.

**Working Hours**

Generally, an employee/workman is not required to work more than 8 hours
a day. There are, however, exceptions to this general rule. You can:

(1) Work for 9 hours in one day (but still not exceeding 44 hours a
    week), if you agree to work less than 8 hours a day on one or more
    days, or work 5 (or less) days a week.

(2) Work for 48 hours a week (or 88 hours over 2 weeks), if you agree to
    work less than 44 hours every alternative week.

(3) Work unlimited hours and on rest days if there is an accident,if the
    work is essential to the life of the community, defence or security,
    or if there is urgent work to be done to machinery or plants.

Equally, an employee/workman is not required to work longer than 6 hours
continuously at any one time. The one exception to this rule is when the
employee/workman is required, due to the nature of the work, to work
continuously for 8 hours, provided that he/she is given a period/s of no
less than 45 minutes to have a meal/s.

If you work more than the above hours you are working overtime and the
employer is required to compensate the employee/workman by paying
him/her one and a half his/her hourly basic rate. Also, it is prohibited
for an employee to work overtime for more than 72 hours a month.

The formula for calculating overtime of pay is: Hourly-rate of pay X 1.5
number of overtime hours

**Rest Time**

You are entitled to have at least 1 rest day a week which need not be a
Sunday.

**Shift Workers**

As a shift worker, your hours or work may differ from those of other
workers. Section 38 of the Act sets out the standard working hours for
non-shift workers. Section 40 of the Act sets out the working hour’s
requirement for shift workers.

Under the section:

(1) You can be required to work more than 6 consecutive hours without a
    break, or more than 8 hours (but not more than 12 hours) a day, or
    more than 44 hours a week (but not more than an average of 44 hours
    per week over a period of 3 weeks.

(2) You can claim overtime if you work more than an average of 44 hours
    per week over a period of 3 weeks.

You must consent in writing to working on shift. Section 38 and 40 of
the Act must be explained to you, otherwise your consent will be
invalid.

**Holidays and Annual Leave**

You are entitled to have an day off on all official public holidays (but
you may agree with your employer to change to another day).




**Annual Leave Entitlement**

If you have served an employer for a period of not less than 3 monthsyou
shall be entitled to a paid annual leave of 7 days in respect of the
first 12 months of continuous service with the same employer, and an
additional one day’s paid annual leave for every subsequent 12 months of
continuous service with the same employer subject to a maximum of 14
days of such leave which shall be in addition to the rest days, holidays
and sick leave to which the employee is entitled under sections 36, 88
and 89 of the Act, respectively.

After working for 3 months, you are entitled to pro-rate your annual
leave. In calculating the pro-rated leave, any fraction which is less
than half a day shall not be counted, and if it is more than half, it
shall be counted as 1 day.

Your employer can forfeit your annual leave if you are from work for
more than 20% of the number of working days in the month or year.

-  | Your annual leave entitlement depends on how long you have worked
     for your employer.
   | An employee is entitled to Annual Leave if they meet the following
     conditions:He/she is covered under Part IV of the Employment Act

-  He/she has worked for at least three months

An employee's annual leave entitlement under Part IV of the Employment
Act is as follows:

+-------------------------------+---------------------+
| **Year of service \***        | **Days of leave**   |
+===============================+=====================+
| 1\ :sup:`st`                  | 7                   |
+-------------------------------+---------------------+
| 2\ :sup:`nd`                  | 8                   |

+-------------------------------+---------------------+
| 4\ :sup:`th`                  | 10                  |
+-------------------------------+---------------------+
| 5\ :sup:`th`                  | 11                  |
+-------------------------------+---------------------+
| 6\ :sup:`th`                  | 12                  |

| 7\ :sup:`th`                  | 13                  |
+-------------------------------+---------------------+
| 8\ :sup:`th` and thereafter   | 14                  |
+-------------------------------+---------------------+

\* where an employee's year of service begins from the day he/she
started work with the employer.

The employer may grant the employee unpaid leave if the employee is not
eligible for annual leave or has used up his annual leave.

The employer can deduct an employee's salary for excess annual leave
taken within the same month, i.e. excess annual leave may be treated as
unpaid leave and deductions made from salary accordingly. Such
deductions, however, must be within the same month in which the excess
leave is taken. If the employer fails to make the deduction within the
same month in which the excess leave is taken, he is not allowed to make
the deduction afterwards. A deduction taken after the month constitutes
an unauthorised deduction under the Employment Act.

**If an employee has worked less than a year**

An employee's annual leave entitlement should be in proportion to the
number of completed months of service in that year (if the employee has
been in service for at least three months). This entitlement also
applies to an employee who has not been confirmed.

If an employee has worked for less than one whole year (i.e. less than
12 months), his/her annual leave should be pro-rated using the following
formula:

(No of months in service/12) x 7

Periods of unpaid leave should not be included when computing annual
leave entitlement.

**Marriage, paternity and compassionate leave entitlement**

There is no statutory entitlement for marriage, paternity and
compassionate leave under the Employment Act. However, regarding
Paternal leave, this gap is filled by the Child Development Co-Savings
Act which provides that a male employee who is the natural father of a
child can take seven days leave within the period of sixteen weeks from
the date of birth of the child.

Alternatively, the employer and male employee may agree to shorter
periods of Paternity leave, not totalling more than 6 days, during the
twelve month period commencing from the date of birth of the child.
Apart from this, the entitlement to such leave may depend on what is
mutually agreed upon in the contract of service.

**Sick Leave**

After 6 months of work, you are entitled to 14 days of
non-hospitalisation sick leave and 60 days of hospitalisation leave. If
you are hospitalised for less than 46 days in any 1 year, your
entitlement to paid sick leave shall not be more than a total of 14 days
and the number of days you are hospitalised.

All sick leave must be certified by a medical officer or a doctor and
you must inform your employer within 48 hours that you are on sick leave
otherwise you will be deemed to be absent from work.

**Retrenchment and Retirement Benefits**

If you have been in continuous service with an employer for less than 3
years you shall not be entitled to any retrenchment benefit on your
dismissal on the ground of redundancy or by reason of any reorganisation
of the employer's profession, business, trade or work.

Your employer can retrench you if you are no longer needed or in case of
a reorganisation of your employer's business. Your employer need not
give any reasons and he cannot be stopped from employing new workers
after a retrenchment exercise.

Retrenchment benefits are therefore payable only if your contract of
service (or a collective agreement if you a union member) says so or if
your employer decides to pay you 'ex-gratia' (gratuitous) retrenchment
benefit.

The Act says that if you have worked for less than 5 years with your
employer you are not entitled to any retirement benefits. The Act
however does not say that if you have worked for at least 5 years with
your employer, you are automatically entitled to retirement benefits.
The amount of retirement benefits is not stated in the Act and must be
negotiated between yourself (or your trade union) and your employer.

**Termination of Contract of Service**

The period of notice for either you or your employer to terminate your
contract of service should be stated in your contract. It should not be
less than the following guidelines in the Act:

+----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| *Period of Employment*           | *Period of Notice*      |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| less than 26 weeks               | not less than 1 day     |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| 26 weeks but less than 2 years   | not less than 1 week    |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| 2 years but less than 5 years    | not less than 2 weeks   |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| 5 years or more                  | not less than 4 weeks   |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------+

Notice can be given at any time, but it must be dated and given in
writing.

Either you or your employer can choose to waive your right to notice.
Either party can also choose not to wait for the notice period to
expire. In this case, the party who does not wish to wait for the expiry
of the notice period must pay the other salary in lieu of notice.

Notice of termination need not be given if there has been a breach of
the terms and conditions of the contract of service. For example, if
your employer fails to pay your salary, or if you feel that you have
been asked to do something which will involve danger, violence or
disease which is not stated in the contract of service, you may leave
your employment without giving notice. (It is advisable to seek advice
from your lawyer or the Ministry of Manpower before doing this). On your
part, your employer need not give you notice if you absent yourself from
work for more than 2 days without prior leave or without reasonable
excuse or attempting to inform your employer.

| The employer can, instead of dismissing you, do the following:
| -  instantly downgrade you; or
| -  instantly suspend you without pay for a period not exceeding 1
  week.

If you think that your employer has acted wrongfully, you can complain
to the Ministry of Manpower within 1 month of the dismissal.

` <http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/awareness/employment.htm#top#top>`__

\ **Maternity Leave**

Maternity leave is your entitlement and it is illegal for your employer
to ask you to give up your maternity leave. During maternity leave you
are entitled to be paid your full salary, you are however not allowed to
claim for sick leave. Your employer is not entitled to terminate your
service and neither are you allowed to give notice of termination using
your maternity leave as the notice period. However, if you work in
another job when you are supposed to be on maternity leave, you can be
dismissed.

Your rights are governed by The Children Development Co-Savings Act.
Female employees are entitled to a maternity leave of 4 weeks before and
12 weeks after delivery of their child. Alternatively, you and your
employer may agree to a period of a 16 weeks commencing not earlier than
28 days before the day of your confinement and not later than the day of
her confinement.

You and your employer can also agree to a period of 8 weeks commencing
not earlier than 28 days immediately preceding the day of your
confinement and not later than the day of your confinement and one or
more further periods, not exceeding 48 days in the aggregate, , which
shall be within the period of 12 months commencing on the day of your
confinement.

| To be entitled to full pay during maternity leave, you must have
  worked for at least 90 days before delivering the child. You are only
  entitled to full pay during maternity leave for your first two
  children.
| You must inform your employer at least 1 week before you commence your
  maternity leave and also inform your employer of the date of delivery
  of your child as soon as possible. If you do not give notice, you will
  only be entitled to half pay unless you have good reason forfailing to
  do so.
| **Annual wage supplement**

If your employer has agreed with you, before 28 August 1988, to pay you
an Annual Wage Supplement ('AWS') of more than one month, that AWS shall
continue to be payable until otherwise agreed.

With effect from 26 August 1988, your contract of service cannot provide
for AWS of more than one month per year.

Depending on your employer's profits, your performance and contribution,
you may get an additional 'variable payment'. This is usually
recommended by the Minister through the National Wage Council or through
negotiations with your employer. Variable payment is not compulsory
unless such payment is provided for in the employment contract or
collective agreement.

| The Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) is commonly known as the 13th month
  payment. It is a single annual payment to employees that supplements
  the total amount of annual wage earned.
| Payment of AWS depends on the contractual agreement between the
  employer and the employee i.e. whether it is provided for in the
  employment contract or a collective agreement.

If it is not stipulated in the employment contract, AWS payment is
subject to negotiation and the mutual agreement between an employer and
employee, or the trade union representing the employee. An employer is
not allowed to pay an AWS of more than three months' salary if:

-  He/she agreed (either by way of an employment contract or collective
   agreement) to pay an AWS of up to three months' wages before the
   commencement of the Employment (Amendment) Act 1988 on 16 August
   1988.

    However, the employer can negotiate with the employee, or the trade
    union representing the employee, to vary the quantum.

An employer is not allowed to pay an AWS of more than one month's wage
if he/she:

-  Has not paid any AWS prior to 16 August 1988.

If business results are exceptionally poor for any year, an employer may
negotiate with the employees, or the trade union representing the
employees, to adjust the AWS downwards.

**Bonus**

A bonus is a one-time payment usually paid to employees at the end of
the year to reward them for their contributions to the company.

Payment of a bonus is not compulsory. However, it is a contractual
obligation for the employer to pay bonus if it is provided for in the
employment contract or collective agreement.

**Variable payment**

A Variable payment is an incentive payment to employees:

(1) To increase their productivity; or

(2) As a reward for their contributions.

The amount of variable payment can be based on trading results,
productivity or any criteria as agreed upon between employers, employees
or trade unions. Variable payments are not compulsory unless such
payment is provided for in the employment contract or collective
agreement\ **.**

**Making a complaint**

| If you have any disagreement with your employer about your salary, the
  terms of your contract or your rights under the Act, you can make a
  complain to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).
| You may lodge a complaint via Employment Standards Online ('ESOL') on
  the MOM website. It is a one-stop portal for organisations and the
  general public to transact with the Labour Relations and Workplaces
  Division ('LRWD'). ESOL for Individual Users allows employees to
  report a breach of the Employment Act.

If you are filing a case on salary matters, you must lodge the case
within 6 months from the date you leave your employment, and the case
must be on issues arising not more than one year from the date the claim
is reported; e.g. a claim for public holiday salary on 25 December 2008
must be filed by 24 December 2009.

| If you think your employer will leave Singapore to avoid paying your
  salary, you can apply to the Commissioner for Workplace Safety and
  Health to ask that your employer give a guarantee to remain in
  Singapore until the salary is paid.
| The Commissioner will inform the party whom you are complaining
  against and summon him and any other interested party to attend an
  inquiry into the complaint. The Commissioner may hold a preliminary
  inquiry and parties are given a change to settle the matter at the
  preliminary inquiry. If a settlement is reached, the Commissioner
  shall make an order to record the terms of the settlement and the
  order shall be as effective as an order made after an inquiry.
| At the inquiry, the Commissioner will hear evidence from all sides to
  the dispute and then make the necessary order. The order can be to
  dismiss the claim or to order a party to pay a sum of money to satisfy
  the claim. The Commissioner can make an order in the absence of one
  party if that party fails to attend the inquiry.
| Any party not satisfied with the Commissioner's order can appeal to
  the High Court within 14 days of the decision.

**Employment of Children and young Persons**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The employment of children and young persons is governed by Part VIII of
the Employment Act and The Employment of Children and Young Persons
Regulations.

-  A child is a person under 15 years of age.

-  A young person is someone 15 years of age or above but under 16 years
   of age.

-  A child must be at least 13 years of age before he/she can be
   employed.

**Suitable forms of work**

A child who is 13 years old or above can only engage in light work
suited to his/her capacity, and cannot work in any industrial
undertaking or vessel unless such undertaking or vessel is under the
personal charge of his/her parent. An industrial undertaking includes
mines, quarries, factories, shipyards, businesses and companies carrying
out construction work or transport (including bus, ship, car, lorry)
operators.

No young person shall be employed in any industrial undertaking declared
by the Minister to be one which cannot employ your persons.

**Transfer of Employment**

An employer has the right to transfer his employees to another employer.
He may do so if there is a restructuring of the organisation. This may
involve another company and can be a merger, take-over, sale of parts of
the employer's operation or setting up a subsidiary company. The
employees can therefore be transferred to a related company such as a
subsidiary or associated company, or to a totally unrelated company.

**Obligations of an Employer to his Employees in a Transfer**

The employer is required to:

a) Notify the affected employees or their union within a reasonable time
   of the impending transfer;

b) Inform the affected employees about the terms of transfer so as to
   enable the employees or their unions to enter into consultations with
   the company; and

c) Ensure that there is continuity of the period of employment of the
   affected employees when they are transferred to a new employer, and
   that their terms of employment are not less favourable than what they
   have been enjoying before the transfer.

**Rights and Obligations of Employees in a Transfer**

The rights of the employees are:

a) To be notified by the employer of the transfer and matters relating
   to the transfer;

b) To be given the opportunity to have a consultation with the employer;
   and

c) To hold the period of employment and terms and conditions of
   employment with the original employer as continuing and preserved
   under his employment with the new employer.

The obligation of the employee is:

-  On his transfer to serve the new employer as if the latter is the
   original employer who had entered into the employment contract with
   him.

**Obligations of Transferee (Employer who takes over the Transferred
Employees)**

The transferee must inform the transferor (previous employer) of matters
relating to the transfer which will affect the employee and the
transferor must convey such information to the employee within a
reasonable period.

On completion of a transfer, the transferee shall take over from the
previous employer all rights, powers, duties and liabiliest which had
been entered into in any contract of service or agreement with the
employee's union before the transfer.

The transferee is not allowed to change any terms and conditions of
employment of the transferred employee unless the transferred employee
agrees.

**Dispute or Disagreement between Transferred Employee or Transferee**

Either party to the dispute or disagreement may refer the matter to the
Commissioner for Labour for adjudication.

The Commissioner is empowered to:

a) Delay or prohibit the transfer of the employee concerned, or

b) Order the transfer of the employee and set such terms as the
   Commissioner considers just.

**Dispute with a Supervisor**

The Ministry has no jurisdiction to intervene in any ‘personal dispute',
e.g. management style or lack of sensitivity on the part of the
employer. The employee is advised to approach the company's top
management if he wishes to lodge a complaint against the behaviour of
the supervisor. Nor does the Ministry intervene in cases of a criminal
nature, as such cases should be referred to the police or other relevant
agencies.

Workmen’s Compensation Act
--------------------------

The Work Injury Compensation Act replaces the Workmen's Compensation Act
from 1 April 2008. The new Act is applicable to accidents that happened
on and after 1 April 2008. For accidents that happened before 1 April
2008, the coverage and benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act
will continue to apply.

All employees who are engaged under a contract of service or
apprenticeship are covered by The Work Injury Compensation Act ,
regardless of their level of earnings. If you are injured by accident or
contract a disease arising in the course of your employment; you may
choose to:

(1) Submit a claim for workmen’s compensation through the Ministry of
    Manpower (which you can inform your employer who will notify
    Ministry of Manpower); or

(2) Claim damages under common law against your employer for breach of
    duty or negligence.

You can claim only under one of the above.

**Common law claim**

You must show that your employer has failed to provide a safe system of
work, breached a duty required by law, or that your employer’s
negligence caused the injury. This may involve commencing legal
proceedingswhich may take up more time and expenses.

Damages under common law are however usually more than an award under
Workmen’s Compensation. Common law damages include compensation for pain
and suffering, loss of wages, medical expenses and any future loss of
earnings.

If you decide to claim under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, you will
usually not be allowed to claim under the common law.

**Workmen’s compensation claim**

All you have to show is that the injury arose in the course of
employment. No negligence or breach of statutory duty on the part of
your employer need be shown. The procedure is relatively simple and
cheap. Awards are however limited and are based on the injury suffered
by him/her.

Under the Work Injury Compensation Act, as an employee you can claim
work injury compensation if you:

a) Sustain injuries or die in a work-related accident; or

Contract occupational diseases arising out of your work. Unlike the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, the new Act covers all employees engaged
under a contract of service or apprenticeship, regardless of their level
of earnings. However, self-employed persons, independent contractors,
domestic workers, members of the Singapore Armed Forces, officers of the
Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Civil Defence Force, the Central
Narcotics Bureau and the Singapore Prison Service are not covered by the
Work Injury Compensation Act.

Similar to the Workmen’s Compensation Act, once you decide to claim
under the Work Injury Act you may not be able to claim under the common
law.

There is a fixed formula in the Act on the amount of compensation to be
awarded, and capped so that the financial liability on your employer is
limited. The no-fault claims and prescribed amounts of compensation
serve to facilitate and expedite claims under the Work Injury
Compensation Act.

**Occupational disease**

There is scheduled list of diseases which if contracted by youin your
occupation will entitle you to claim compensation. The diseases include
deafness, asbestosis, and industrial dermatitis. You should consult the
Ministry of Manpower or a lawyer for further information.

Workplace Safety and Health Act
-------------------------------

In effect since 1 March 2006, The Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA)
is an essential part of the new framework to cultivate good safety
habits in all individuals so as to engender a strong safety culture in
your workplace. It emphasises the importance of managing workplace
safety and health proactively by requiring stakeholders to take
reasonably practicable measures to ensure the safety and health of
workers and other people that are affected by the work being carried
out.

**Guiding principles**

The 3 guiding principles that underpin the new OSH framework are:

a) Reducing risks at source by requiring all stakeholders to eliminate
   or minimize the risks they create;

b) Instilling greater ownership of safety and health outcomes by
   industry; and

c) Preventing accidents through higher penalties for poor safety
   management

It goes beyond the prescriptive nature of Factories Act (which it has
replaced) to:

a) Specify liabilities for a range of persons at the workplace;

b) Focus more on workplace safety and health goals and systems; and

c) Stipulate greater penalties for compromising safety and health.

**Key reforms under WSHA**

The key reforms with the new WSHA;

a) Allows a gradual increase in scope to cover all workplaces;

b) Assigns responsibilities to a range of stakeholders at the workplace
   along lines of control;

c) Focuses on workplace safety and health systems and outcomes;

d) Provides for more effective enforcement through the issuance of
   “remedial orders”; and

e) Provides for higher penalties for non-compliant and risk-taking
   behaviour to prevent accidents upfront.

Credit Card and Bank Debts; Insurance Disputes
----------------------------------------------

**Credit Counseling Service (CCS)**

The idea for CCS began as early as 2001 when judges from the Subordinate
Courts expressed their concern over problems caused to individuals and
families by the rising consumer credit indebtedness. The CCS aims to
promote the responsible use of credit and money management through
education. The CCS alao aims to assist consumers to recover from serious
debt problems by providing general credit management information, credit
counselling and where applicable, put up a debt repayment plan for
suitable consumers.

**Seeking Assistance from CCS**

There is this 3-step process to seek assistance from CCS:

**Step 1 –** Free information on debt management:

-  The consumer is invited to attend a free info talk that is conducted
   on a weekly basis. This compulsory talk explains the various options
   in handling a debt problem and the common collection actions taken by
   the creditors. It also explains the services offered by the CCS so
   that the consumer can self-assess and decide what he wants to do
   next.

-  Consumers are requested to call 1800 CALL CCS (MUST dial 1800 before
   2255 227 to get through to CCS) between Mondays – Fridays, 9 am – 6
   pm, to register for the talk.

**Step 2** – Credit Counselling:

If the consumer wishes to seek further assistance after he has attended
the free info talk, he needs to collect the Counselling Session Request
Package and complete and submit it with photocopies of the necessary
documents to CCS. We will then set up a one-to-one counselling session
for him to discuss his situation in details with a credit counsellor.
Consumers are requested to submit only PHOTOCOPIES of the required
documents together with the duly completed Counselling Session Request
Package to CCS.

The counselling session ascertains the most appropriate solution to the
debt problem. It does not necessarily lead to a Debt Management
Programme.

**Step 3** – Set up a Debt Management Programme (DMP):

At the counselling session, the counsellor will try to assist the
consumer to identify the most appropriate solution for his debt problem.
If at the end of the counselling session, both the consumer and his
counsellor concur that the Debt Management Programme (DMP) is the most
suitable option, the CCS will work on it, subject to the DMP Review
Committee’s approval and put it up for the creditors’ consideration and
acceptance.

Consumers are requested to be upfront on all their assets, liabilities,
income and other resources available and be open-minded to explore the
various options in resolving their debt problem.

**Debt Management Programme**

The Debt Management Programme, known as DMP, is basically a debt
repayment plan. It is an installment plan that allows the consumers to
gradually repay their unsecured debt (eg. credit cards and overdraft),
the principal amount plus interest charges, to their creditors over a
period of time.

This repayment plan is suitable for consumers who are willing, i.e. have
the desire to avoid bankruptcy and the determination to live within a
discipline budget, and ability ie, have the means to repay the unsecured
debt that they owe.

The DMP is a voluntary arrangement between the consumers and the
creditors. In short, it is the creditors’ discretion whether to offer an
installment plan and the terms of the repayment.

**Options in Debt Handling**

There are basically four options in handling a debt problem, namely,
Self Administration, Voluntary Arrangement, Debt Management Programme
(DMP) and Bankruptcy.

**Option 1:** Self Administration

As the name suggest, the consumers administer the debt problem
themselves by liaising with the creditors directly to explain their
financial plights and appeal for assistance from the creditors (eg. an
installment plan to repay the debt owed).

**Option 2:** Voluntary Arrangement

The consumers need to engage a licensed professional (eg. lawyer or
accountant) to make a composite offer to their creditors. Alternatively,
the consumer may also raise the money and negotiate with the creditors
directly themselves, and appeal for a discounted lump sum settlement of
the debt.

**Option 4:** Bankruptcy

This serves as the last resort when all else fails to resolve the debt
problem. The consumer may either wait to be sued by the creditors or
file a self-declare bankruptcy petition at the Insolvency and Public
Trustee’s Office.

The FIDReC is an independent and impartial institution specialising in
the resolution of disputes between financial institutions and consumers.
FIDReC subsumes the work of the Consumer Mediation Unit (CMU) of the
Association of Banks in Singapore and the Insurance Disputes Resolution
Organisation (IDRO).

FIDReC provides an affordable and accessible one-stop avenue for
consumers to resolve their disputes with financial institutions. It also
streamlines the dispute resolution processes across the entire financial
sector of Singapore.

FIDReC provides an affordable avenue for consumers who do not have the
resources to go to court or who do not want to pay hefty legal fees. It
is staffed by full-time employees familiar with the relevant laws and
practices.

The Consumer Credit Bureau
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Credit Bureau (Singapore) Pte Ltd (CBS) is Singapore's consumer credit
bureau. It is a joint venture between The Association of Banks in
Singapore (ABS) and DBIC Holdings Pte Ltd. The setting up of a consumer
credit bureau in Singapore is in line with the Monetary Authority of
Singapore’s vision to enhance the Republic's risk management capability.

Since 2002, the Banking Act has allowed Credit Bureau (Singapore)
members, which include banks, credit card companies and other financial
institutions, to disclose credit-related information and obtain such
information from Credit Bureau (Singapore) for the purpose of checking
on their existing and prospective customers’ creditworthiness. These
member banks and credit card companies must first be recognised by MAS.

Credit Bureau (Singapore)’s goal is to help credit providers make better
lending decisions quickly and more objectively. To do this, Credit
Bureau (Singapore) aggregates credit-related information amongst
participating members and presents a more complete risk profile of a
customer to credit providers. This helps credit providers determine the
likelihood of the customer repaying, thus enhancing their risk
assessment capabilities.

**What is a consumer credit bureau?**

A consumer credit bureau is a repository of factual information on the
credit application and repayment records of consumers only. A credit
bureau provides this information to its members (credit providers),
under authorised conditions, to help them to determine whether or not
the person applying for credit is likely to repay. In doing this, a
credit bureau helps lenders make better lending decisions quickly and
objectively. It also guards against fraud. Credit bureaus are a common
feature of developed countries around the world, and this concept is not
unique to Singapore.

**How does the Credit Bureau (Singapore) benefit me?**

Credit Bureau (Singapore)’s data is aimed at helping credit providers to
make faster and more objective lending decisions. This also contributes
to a more competitive credit marketplace among the credit providers.
With the Bureau in place, responsible customers can expect faster and
more competitive services from the credit providers.

**How does Credit Bureau (Singapore) work?**

In order for credit providers such as banks to gain a fuller
understanding of the credit applicant, they must be able to gain access
to the applicant’s complete credit record that may be spread over
different institutions. This can be used to supplement other information
to help banks make their decisions to grant credit. Credit Bureau
(Singapore) stores and provides these credit records in the form of
credit reports to enquiring institutions that must first be members of
the Bureau. To do this, all Credit Bureau (Singapore) members need to
contribute specific credit performance data to the Credit Bureau.

**Where does Credit Bureau (Singapore) get its information?**

Credit Bureau (Singapore) draws its information mainly from members and
supplements it with publicly available information, such as bankruptcy
information.

**Is it legal for the banks to share the information of its consumers?**

Yes. The Banking Act (Sixth Schedule) provides the legal framework on
the use of customer information. Banks are only permitted to disclose
specific credit-related information to the recognised Credit Bureau.
Banks are not allowed to disclose deposit information. This includes any
funds, safe deposit boxes or safe custody arrangements of a customer
under management by a bank.

**Do all banks contribute data to Credit Bureau (Singapore)?**

Yes. It is intended that all retail banks that are members of ABS
participate in Credit Bureau (Singapore) as an industry-wide practice
contribute credit performance data under legally permitted conditions.

**Is Credit Bureau (Singapore) regulated?**

Credit Bureau (Singapore) is self-regulated. Credit Bureau (Singapore)
and all authorised members must adhere to a strict Code of Conduct in
the handling of consumer data. Credit Bureau (Singapore) and all
authorised members will have contractual agreements based on this Code.
The Bureau has been gazetted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) and must operate in a prudent manner to maintain its gazetted
status.

**Will Credit Bureau (Singapore)'s Code of Conduct be verified or
accredited with any symbol of best business practices or a trust mark?**

Yes. Credit Bureau (Singapore) has been awarded accreditation from both
the CaseTrust Accreditation Scheme and Trust SG Certification.

**Is Credit Bureau (Singapore)’s Code of Conduct available to the
public?**

Yes. Click here to view the Bureau's Code of Conduct.

**Who can access my credit report?**

Only Credit Bureau (Singapore) and other MAS-approved institutions
participating in Credit Bureau (Singapore) have access to a consumer's
credit report. The purpose for such access is restricted to the
assessment of credit-worthiness of the consumers, and to disclose any
other person is prohibited. All authorised personnel (of both members
and the Bureau) will have unique ID and passwords to identify themselves
when they access the Bureau’s database. Access by unauthorised personnel
is prohibited. All access to the Bureau’s database is tracked.

**Can Credit Bureau (Singapore) provide my information to companies such
as direct marketing companies?**

No. Credit Bureau (Singapore) can only provide information to its
members, who can only access the information for credit-worthiness
checks. Credit Bureau (Singapore) must also maintain a high standard of
confidentiality and prudent operations for the Bureau to keep its
gazetted status. Without the gazetted status, it will be illegal for
banks to provide customer information to Credit Bureau (Singapore).

**Can Credit Bureau (Singapore) provide credit report information to
credit providers** **in other countries?**

No. Credit Bureau (Singapore) can only provide credit report information
to its members in Singapore.




**Are all my personal profile data held by my bank reported and
disclosed to Credit** **Bureau (Singapore) and its members?**

Not all your personal profile data held by your bank is reported to the
Bureau. Only your basic personal profile data such as name, gender,
nationality, ID, occupation, date of birth and postal code (without your
full address and contact numbers) may be provided to Credit Bureau
(Singapore). These are required for matching data from various sources
to the correct individuals. Banks also use them to conduct data
verification in their credit-worthiness assessment process. Such basic
personal profile data is in the credit report that members of Credit
Bureau (Singapore) can access for the purpose of credit-worthiness
assessment only. As an added data privacy safeguard measure, Credit
Bureau (Singapore) has subscribed to the CaseTrust Accreditation Scheme
and has subjected its system and procedures to assessment by CaseTrust.
Data privacy protection is one of the principles that CaseTrust requires
its members to adhere to.

**How does Credit Bureau (Singapore) ensure that information in the
database is kept safely?**

Credit Bureau (Singapore)'s security measures are aligned with stringent
risk management standards and are subjected to regular audits and
testing by leading IT service companies. The CaseTrust scheme also
requires that a standard of data security be met before Credit Bureau
(Singapore) is accredited.

**What additional safeguards are there to protect my data in Credit
Bureau** **(Singapore)’s database?**

In addition to the strict access of dataonly to authorised Bureau
members, the restricted use only for credit-worthiness assessment and
the IT security of the database, access to your own credit report allows
you to dispute any information that you feel is inaccurate. This will
help to ensure that the data held by Credit Bureau (Singapore) is
accurate.

**Banks Lending Decisions**

**Does the credit report indicate if credit should or should not be
given?**

The credit report only shows the factual credit data available and does
not opine, indicate nor comment if credit should or should not be
granted.

**Who makes the decision to grant credit?**

The banks or other credit providers with whom you have applied for
credit make the credit decisions. Credit Bureau (Singapore) does not
grant nor deny credit.

**Will Credit Bureau (Singapore) know why I have been denied credit?**

No. The decision to grant or deny credit is made by the banks or credit
providers.

**Does Credit Bureau (Singapore) have any “blacklists”?**

No. Credit Bureau (Singapore) only provides specific factual
credit-related information about consumers who have credit or loan
facilities.

**If my credit application has been rejected, will this fact appear in
my credit record?**

No. The members do not provide such information to Credit Bureau
(Singapore). As such, it will not be in an individual’s credit report.

**If I have been denied credit by a bank, will others also reject me?**

Not necessarily. Different credit providers may use information
differently, or take into account other factors when they assess your
application. Although one bank may deny you credit, another bank may
take a different view and accept your application. If you have been
denied credit, you may wish to review your credit report, which you can
obtain from Credit Bureau (Singapore) free of charge.

**When is an account classified as “default”?**

This is a commercial decision by the credit provider, and may depend on
a variety of factors. In normal cases, the Account will be 90 days +
overdue before it is classified as in default. Credit Bureau (Singapore)
however does not determine when an account is classified as default, and
merely reflects this information after the bank has classified it as
such.

**How long does information remain on my credit report?**

The relative importance of each type of information differs in
credit-worthiness assessment. As such, information remains in the credit
report for members' use in their credit-worthiness assessment in the
following manner: Previous enquiries made on your report are displayed
indefinitely. Records on the promptness of monthly repayments for the
past 12 months are displayed closed or terminated. Credit accounts will
be displayed for 3 years from the date the account was reported closed
or terminated. Default records, if any, will be displayed for 6 years
from the date it was uploaded to Credit Bureau (Singapore). Bankruptcy
data, if any, will be displayed for 6 years from the date of discharge.

**How do I avoid having negative information on me from being sent to
the bureau?**

The best preventive measure is to exercise good money management and
make repayments on time.

**If I am a first-time borrower, will I be disadvantaged as there will
be** **no information on me?**

As a new borrower, a new file will be created for you. This is not
considered a disadvantage. It will then be in your interest to build up
a favourable repayment track record for future credit applications.

Defamation
----------

| **Definitions**
| *Defamation* can be a civil or criminal cause of action. The tort of
  defamation is a civil cause of action which allows a person to claim
  for damages for the injury caused to his reputation as a result of
  defamatory material that was published by the defendant to a third
  party. The claimant may also seek injunctions to restrain future
  publications and force the defendant to withdraw the defamatory
  statement.

Criminal defamation occurs whenever a person, by words either spoken or
intended to be read, or by signs or visible representations, makes or
publishes any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or
knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the
reputation of such person. The mens rea of the offence, namely intention
or knowledge, is negated by grounds of mental incapacity or unsoundness.

*Libel* refers to defamation that is published in writing in permanent
form, for example, on film, CD, DVD, internet blogging, etc.

*Slander* refers to offending statement(s) in transient or temporal
form, e.g. spoken words or sounds, sign language, gestures or the like.

Tort of Defamation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Elements of a prima facie case for defamation**

There are 3 main legal requirements to establish a prima facie case:

(1) The statement must be defamatory in nature;

(2) The statement must refer to the plaintiff; and

(3) The statement must be published.

In general, a statement is defamatory in nature if it tends to:

(1) lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of
    society generally;

(2) cause the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided;

(3) expose the plaintiff to hatred, ridicule or contempt.

The test of whether subject material is defamatory or not is “what would
a reasonable reader perceive as the material’s natural and ordinary
meaning in its full context”; what the author or publisher intended is
irrelevant.

Words which appear innocuous may also be understood to be disparaging of
the plaintiff to third parties who have knowledge of special facts which
are not generally known. This is known as a true innuendo.

In other words, there can be different levels of defamatory meaning that
may arise from a particular statement.

Although an opinion cannot be considered defamatory, merely labeling a
statement as “opinion” does not make it so. The Court will look at
whether a reasonable reader would have understood the statement to be an
opinion or as a statement of verifiable fact.

Libel is actionable *per se* , eg the statement needn’t have caused
any actual damage Slander however requires such proof unless specific
common law and statutory exceptions apply.

**Defences for Defamation**
The following are defences to a claim for defamation:

-  | **Justication**: the information was true. If a statement infers
     something greater than the literal meaning of the words used,
     proving that the statement is literally true is insufficient.
   | **Fair Comment**: includes content or opinion that cannot by its
     nature be true or false. The statements must be shown to be based
     on fact, made in good faith, published without malice and as a
     matter of public interest.
   | **Absolute Privilege**: the law allows for individuals to speak
     freely without fear of being sued (even if they have their facts
     wrong) in court proceedings and Parliament debates, and for fair
     and accurate reporting of such proceedings.
   | **Qualified Privilege**: Qualified privilege may be defeated by
     proof that the defendant’s statements were motivated by malice.
     Qualified privilege may arise in one or more of the following
     circumstances: (a) the defendant has an interest or duty to
     communicate information and the recipient has the corresponding
     interest or duty to receive the information; (b) the defendant
     makes a statement with a view to protecting his or her
     self-interests; or (c) fair and accurate reporting of parliamentary
     and judicial proceedings.

-  **Innocent dissemination:** this defence is available to
   intermediaries such as retail vendors and distributors, libraries and
   delivery agents. The intermediary must prove that: (a) he did not
   know that the publication was libellous; (b) the circumstances or the
   work could not have alerted the defendant to the libellous content;
   (c) such ignorance was not due to his or her negligence.

-  **Offer of amends**: Section 7 of the Defamation Act provides a
   defence to a defendant to ward off a potential defamation action or
   to procure the discontinuance of such an action if he is able to
   prove that he had innocently defamed another person and if he offers
   to publish a suitable correction and apology and take steps to inform
   the parties who have received the defamatory material that the
   contents were defamatory to the aggrieved party.

-  **Assent by the plaintiff**: the plaintiff had clearly and
   unequivocally assented to the publication of the defamatory statement
   by the defendant.

**Actions to Take to Defend a Defamation Claim**
The Respondent should obtain legal advice as soon as possible before
responding to the Claimant. Check the original statement and carry out
all associated investigative work prior to publication.

The Respondent should consider withdrawing his statement if, on
checking, he thinks his statement was wrong. All drafts and evidence
should be retained. All those involved in the writing and research
conducted before the publication of the statement should be made aware
of the situation and the fact that they may have to provide evidence or
statements.

If the Respondent has libel insurance, he should inform his insurers and
comply with their requests for information.

**Criminal Defamation**

Section 499 of the Penal Code provides for the offence of criminal
defamation. The elements of the crime have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

There are a number of statutory exceptions under section 499 of the
Penal Code. It is not criminal defamation to:

-  Impute anything which is true concerning another person for public
   good. The interest of the public is a question of fact.

-  Express in good faith, any opinion of the conduct of any person
   touching on his discharge of his public functions or any public
   question, respecting his character, so far as his character appears
   in that conduct but no further.

-  Express in good faith, any opinion whatsoever regardingthe conduct of
   any person touching on any public question, and respecting his
   character, so far as his character appears in that conduct, and no
   further.

-  Publish a substantially true report of proceedings in a court of
   justice or of parliament, or the result of such proceedings.

-  Express in good faith any opinion on the merits of a case or the
   conduct of any person as a party of the proceedings in a court of
   justice.

-  Express in good faith any opinion respecting the merits of any
   performance which its author has submitted to the judgment of the
   public, or respecting the character of the author so far as his
   character appears in such performance, and no further.

-  Pass censure in good faith, on the conduct of another person in
   matters where one has legal authority over or are relevant to their
   legal authority.

-  Proffer in good faith an accusation against any person to those who
   have lawful authority over that person with respect to the
   subject-matter of the accusation.

-  Impute on the character of another in the protection of his own
   interest, of any other persons or for the public good.

-  Convey a caution for the good of the person to whom it is conveyed or
   a third party whom that person is interested or for the public good.

The maximum penalty for criminal defamation is imprisonment for a term
which may extend to 2 years, a fine, or both.

Defamation FAQs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**What action can I take against online defamation?**

The legal process is the same as for any other defamation action. The
primary legal remedy is to bring an action against the publisher for
defamation. Please note, however, that there may other complicated
issues that arise from such a factual scenario including questions on
jurisdiction and obtaining the full name and address of the defendant to
commence and effect the defamation process.

Other practical solutions include asking the website administrator or
person who posted the comment to remove the defamatory material from the
website and to issue a correction statement.

**Can I take action against a newspaper/magazine for leaking a story?**

More details would be required to find out what cause of action would
arise out of the action of “leaking a story”. Potential causes of action
could include breach of confidentiality [12]_.

Harassment
^^^^^^^^^^^

The common law tort of harassment has now been abolished and substituted
by the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA). POHA broadens the current
scope of laws against harassment to include both acts committed in the
real world, as well as in the online world, such as cyber-bullying and
workplace sexual harassment. It also creates the new offence of unlawful
stalking.

However, the operation of the Act shall only take full force of law, and
therefore become operational, once it has been published in the
Government Gazette. As of today, this has still yet to occur.

Hence, any offence which has been committed under the Tort of Harassment
would still be valid until the commencement of the Act.

**What offences does the Act cover?**

The Act provides for the following offences, namely:

-  (a) Where an individual intentionally harasses or causes alarm or
   distress to the victim;

-  (b) Where an individual uses threatening, abusive or insulting words
   or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm and distress to a victim;

-  (c) Where an individual uses threatening, abusive or insulting words
   or behaviour to cause fear to the victim, or provoke actual violence
   by the victim;

-  (d) Where an individual uses threatening, insulting, abusive or
   indecent words or behaviour at a public servant or public service
   worker; and

-  (e) Where an individual commits unlawful stalking, by demonstrating
   behaviour associated with stalking which causes harassment, alarm or
   distress to the victim.

The Act also criminalizes actions carried out in Singapore towards a
victim who is overseas, as well as actions caried out from overseas
towards a victim in Singapore. This could potentially apply to
cross-border offences such as cyber-stalking.

**What are the punishments for committing any of the above crimes?**

-  For offence (a) above, the punishment is a fine up to $5,000 and/or
   imprisonment up to six months; this fine can be increased to $10,000
   and/or imprisonment of up to twelve months for repeat offences

-  For offence (b) above, the punishment is a fine up to $5,000; this
   fine can be increased to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to six
   months for repeat offences

-  For offence (c) above, the punishment is a fine up to $5,000 and/or
   imprisonment up to twelve months; this fine can be increased to
   $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to two years for repeat offences

-  For offence (d) above, the punishment is a fine up to $5,000 and/or
   imprisonment up to twelve months, and; this fine can be increased up
   to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to two years for repeat offences

-  For offence (e) above, the punishment is a fine up to $5,000 and/or
   imprisonment up to twelve months; this fine can be increased to
   $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to two years for repeat offences

**What remedies can a victim obtain?**

The Act will allow a victim to seek the following remedies from a court,
namely:

-  A protection order to be granted by the District Court which will
   order the alleged perpetrator to stop doing the thing which he/she is
   accused of, stop publishing any harassing material or refer both the
   accused and victim to attend a mediation centre for counselling;

-  An expedited protection order, which is similar to the above remedy
   except that this order can be granted without the alleged perpetrator
   being notified beforehand;

-  An award of monetary damages for breach of statutory tort. The
   claimant will have to prove on the balance of probabilities that the
   defendant breached one of the offences in the Act;

-  An order from the District Court that a false statement of fact shall
   not be published by an individual, unless notification is given of
   the falsehood of the statement accompanied by the true facts.

Wheel clamping
--------------

**Why was my vehicle wheel clamped?**

Car park operators will clamp unauthorised/illegallyparked vehicles.

Examples of parking offences include unauthorized parking at reserved
lots with stand up signs; parking in a manner causing obstruction at car
park driveways; parking at Fire Engine Hard Standing Areas/Fire Engine
Access and at lots reserved for the physically challenged; unauthorized
parking at staff parking lots; unauthorized/ illegal parking that
compromise the safety, health, environment and security of the
university community.

Owners of the vehicle will need to pay an administrative fee to release
the wheel clamp.

**When is wheel clamping trespass?**

Owners of the vehicle may have an action in trespass against the car
park operators.

The act of clamping the wheel of another person's car, even when that
car was trespassing, is an act of trespass to that other person's
property unless it could be shown that the owner of the car had
consented to, or willingly assumed the risk of, his car being clamped
i.e. car owner was aware of the consequences of parking his car so that
it trespassed on the land of another [13]_.

**When will the car owner be found to have consented to orwillingly
assumed risk of the car being clamped?**

Normally, the presence of notices warning that cars areliable to be
clamped if left in that place without permission which were clearly
visible , (for example at the entrance to a private car park), and were
of a type which the car driver would be expected to have read, would
lead to a finding that the car driver had knowledge of and appreciated
the warning.

Where a driver sees a notice and appreciates that it contains terms
concerning the basis on which he is to come onto another's land, but
does not read it and thus does not fully understand the precise terms,
he will not be able to say, in the absence of unusual circumstances,
that he did not consent to and willingly assume the risk of being
clamped [14]_.
