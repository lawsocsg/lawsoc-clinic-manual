CLINIC MANAGEMENT
=================

Conduct
~~~~~~~

All data relating to the legal clinic is confidential and is **not** to
be revealed to anyone not directly related to the service. The lawyers
will be governed by the relevant sections of the Legal Profession Act
and relevant ethical rules during their interactions with clients. In
the event that the applicant has sought the advice of another lawyer,
you may deal with the case as you see fit.

Confidentiality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the rules mentioned above, the CDC shall not release the
names or contact details of any of the lawyers volunteering at the legal
clinic.

You are not to give your name, the name of your firm or any details by
which the client may be able to identify or locate you.

Support
~~~~~~~

A copy of the Community Legal Clinic Manual will be provided to each
lawyer prior to the clinic.

Before beginning to volunteer at the clinic, it is suggested that
lawyers sit in on at least one session with an experienced volunteer
lawyer (mentor). It is proposed that there be at least one mentor
present at each session.

New volunteers are encouraged to consult the designated mentor in the
event of doubt. They are also encouraged to attend such training
sessions to be conducted by the Law Society under the auspices of the
Pro Bono Services Office as necessary.

A copy of the Women’s Charter, Penal Code and other Statutes related to
family and criminal Law, information on Legal Aid Bureau, Family Court,
Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and The Law Society of Singapore Directory are
available for reference at the Community Legal Clinic. You may consult
the other volunteer lawyers for their opinion.

In case you feel the clinic attendee is eligible for legal aid – civil
or criminal, or needs referral to particular services such as
counselling or financial aid, please let the PBS Officer know. They will
carry out the appropriate follow-up after the legal consultation.

In some cases, clinic attendees may be emotionally charged over the
matter. If at any point you feel that the clinic attendee needs
emotional support, please request assistance from the PBS Officer.

Forms

Before each clinic session, you will be furnished a summary of each
clinic attendee’s problem/area of enquiry (see page 3-2 for a sample).

For each attendee, you will need to complete a green form (FORM A, see
page 3-5 for a sample) which is essentially the attendance note for you
to record the advice given to the client.

The Clinic Case List contains information about the clinic applicants
registered for each session and a short narrative of the problem and
issues on which advice is sought.

Form A and the Clinic Case List are NOT to be handed to the client.

Fill in FORM A after the consultation, giving a short synopsis of the
advice offered. If you have suggested a second consultation, make a note
on FORM A and inform the PBS Officer of this. As a rule, we do not
register applicants for a second consultation over the same issue unless
there are special circumstances requiring further legal advice.

Applicants
~~~~~~~~~~

As a rule, each applicant is given a maximum of 20 minutes. The duty PBS
Officer will advise if there is adequate time. If there are fewer
applicants, the length of consultation may be lengthened at your own
discretion.

All applicants who have registered for the Community Legal Clinic will
be seen on the night itself. As far as possible, we avoid turning
applicants away. Applicants (and anyone accompanying them) will be
required to provide their identification for verification purposes, as
well as sign a Disclaimer of Liability before being allowed to consult
with the lawyer.

Clinic times and venues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registration and arrangements for appointments at the four Community
Legal Clinics are handled by the Pro Bono Services Office. The clinics
are hosted by the NW, SW, SE and Central CDCs. Volunteer’s lawyers will
have the use of interview rooms at the CDC office. A Pro Bono Service
Officer will be at the reception counter of the CDC office to usher the
clients into the interview rooms where the advice is given. The times

Clinic Checklist for Volunteer Lawyers
--------------------------------------

The following checklist will assist the volunteer lawyer when dealing
with the attendee during the clinic session.

**Explain to the clinic attendee the Disclaimer of Liability**. You
could say:

*The purpose of the Community Legal Clinic is to provide free advice
to all those in need. The advice given at these sessions shall be as a
matter of guidance and comfort only and is not intended to replace,
substitute or supplement legal advice and legal action that may be
needed. The information provided by attendees to the volunteer lawyers
shall be kept confidential. Please note that the volunteer lawyers are
under a legal prohibition from acting any further for attendees. For the
free advice given, The Law Society of Singapore and its volunteer
lawyers and/or their practices shall not be liable in any way whatsoever
for any such advice or information.*

**You are discouraged from revealing your name, the name of your firm,
or any details by which the applicant can identify or locate you, to the
clinic attendee.** This reduces the likelihood of the attendee tracing
you for further advice or representation.

**Adhere to the time limit of 20 minutes allocated**. This is to ensure
that everyone gets the same amount of time with you.

**Be polite and courteous at all times to members of the public.** If
you have any problems or experience difficulties with any member of the
public, please approach the duty Pro Bono Service Officer for
assistance.

**Do not attend to a member of public who has a solicitor on record.**
It is likely that you will not be told of all the facts within 20
minutes and any advice given by you may be in conflict with the advice
already given by the solicitor on record. If you **do** find out that
the person is represented by a lawyer, immediately inform the person
that you cannot give advice and terminate the session.

**Do not give specific advice on “legal costs”, especially on
professional charges for a specific matter.** You may, however, explain
the basis for charging and taxation of bill costs.

**Keep an accurate record of the nature of the advice sought and the
advice rendered by you in the attendance note provided.** Although there
is a disclaimer the member of public would have signed, an accurate
record will help us deal with complaint(s) later should any arise.

Making Referrals
----------------

The Pro Bono Officer will inform you of the appropriate referrals for
the clinic attendees. You may then indicate the relevant information on
Form B (blue form) and/or C (purple form) and hand this to the clinic
attendee at the end of the session. Below is a list of agencies
providing follow-up services. The services they provide are described in
this section.

In the course of counselling, you may decide that additional referral
action is required. Record the type of help required on Form A (the
green form) and inform the PBS Officer who will then arrange for the
client to contact the appropriate agency for further assistance.

   advertisers, and withdrawal of the trading privileges from
   advertising agencies. Both these sanctions are applied by the media
   owners.

\ *The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA)*
------------------------------------------------------

Under the CPFTA, CASE and Singapore Tourism Board are empowered to
invite errant businesses to enter into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement,
failing which, to take an injunction to stop the business from engaging
in further unfair practices.

The consumer should first seek to resolve the dispute with the trader.
Businesses should consider having in place a dispute resolution or
alternative mediation process so that there is a platform for settling
disputes with consumers. Currently, mediation services are available
through Community Mediation Centres, Singapore Mediation Centre, CASE
and various industry-specific mediation facilities. If the dispute
cannot be settled, the consumer may file a claim in court for civil
remedies. Most claims for unfair practices under the Act should be filed
in the Small Claims Tribunal. The consumer may also have rights of
action under contract or tort law. The consumer should seek legal advice
in case of uncertainty.

When considering a claim for unfair practices under the Act, prior
granting remedies the court will take into account whether the consumer
made a reasonable effort to minimise any loss or damage resulting from
the unfair practice, and tried to resolve the dispute through a
specified dispute resolution scheme. The Financial Industry Disputes
Resolution Centre Ltd (FIDReC) has been prescribed as the specified
dispute resolution scheme in respect of disputes relating to MAS-related
financial products or services supplied by a subscriber to FIDReC.

construction disputes. This Scheme takes advantage of the respective
skills and expertise of these mediators to better resolve conflicts in
management corporations and private estates jointly. It will benefit
residents and occupants in these private developments and help to
promote good neighbourliness and community cohesion. This Scheme will
only deal with relational disputes such as quarrels, environmental
problems arising from noise or leakage, use of common facilities, and
disagreements with Council members and residents

(Nearest MRT Station: City Hall)

Mediation is a solutions-driven, problem-solving process. Instead of
pitting parties against each other, SMC facilitates an objective
discussion on how to advance difficult situations. The goal of mediation
is to find a practical solution and acceptable settlement.

Their process is carefully managed and facilitated by one of their
professional mediators. All SMC mediators have undergone mediation
training of the highest standards. They are respected, senior members of
the legal profession or are industry experts in their respective fields.
Their experience and training help parties identify issues, negotiate
constructively and explore different ways of settling.

Key to mediation is that parties make their own decisions, often with
the help of their lawyers. They are in complete control of the outcome
and do not run the risk of having an unfavourable decision imposed upon
them by a judge or arbitrator. 

\ *Primary Justice Project*
---------------------------

The PJP is a joint collaboration between the State Courts, the Law
Society, the Community Justice Centre and other justice stakeholders.
The PJP encourages the public to explore amicable settlement of disputes
as it provides an interim step between self-help and commencing action
in the courts.

Under this scheme, a party who has a dispute may approach any lawyer
listed on the Primary Justice panel, who provide basic legal advice and
facilitate a settlement of the dispute at a fixed fee.

**How PJP can help**

Parties may apply for PJP of their case falls under the following
categories:

(1) *Civil claims of less than $60,000* (e.g. claims for breach of
    contract, defamation) and which fall outside the Small Claims
    Tribunals' jurisdiction, including consumer claims, tenancy
    disputes, MCST disputes, defamation and employment disputes; and

(2) *Divorce matters where most ancillary matters are close to
    settlement* (e.g. maintenance; matrimonial property; matrimonial
    assets).

Setup in 1996 under the Maintenance of Parents Act (Chapter 167B), the
TMP provides a legal channel for elderly parents to seek maintenance
from their children who are capable of supporting them, but are not
willing to do so.

The Tribunal, comprising a President and his members, hears applications
for maintenance or variation of maintenance orders. It adopts a
non-adversarial stance and refers the differences between the parties to
a conciliation officer for mediation before applications are heard. The
Ministry provides the services of a Commissioner and the secretariat to
support the Tribunal.

**Who May Apply**

Any person 60 years and above, domiciled and resident in Singapore
unable to maintain himself adequately can claim maintenance from their
children..

A person below 60 years may also apply if the Tribunal is satisfied that
he is suffering from infirmity of mind or body or for other special
reasons which prevent him or makes it difficult to maintain himself.

An approved person or organization in whose care a parent resides may
apply to the Tribunal for an order for maintenance from one or more of
his children. Any person/organization must apply to the Minister for
Community Development for approval to be an approved person /
organization before filing an application for maintenance.

The Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents appointed under the
Maintenance of Parents Act may also make an application on a parent’s
behalf.
