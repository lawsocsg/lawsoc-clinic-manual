DATA PROTECTION LAW
===================

Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (‘PDPA’)
------------------------------------------

The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) fully came into force on 2 July
2014, which:

1. Establishes protection over the collection, use, disclosure, access
   and correction, and care of personal data belonging to individuals;

2. Provides for the establishment of the Do-Not-Call Registry (“DNC
   Registry”), at which individuals register their Singapore phone
   number to prevent marketers from sending them unsolicited mobile text
   messages, calls or faxes.

"Personal data" is data, whether true or not, about an individual.
Therefore, even false information can be considered “personal data”, if
it can be used to identify an individual.

The personal data must have "identifiability", in that an individual is
likely to be identified from that personal data, by a determined person
with a particular purpose to want to identify the individual.

The personal data should be significant in some sense; it should have
some value – monetary or otherwise.

What’s Excluded

1. Personal data in a record that has existed for at least one hundred
   (100) years;

2. Personal data about a deceased individual (except if the individual
   has been deceased for 10 years or less);

3. Business contact information, unless otherwise specifically
   mentioned. This is defined as as information which has not been
   provided by the individual solely for his personal purpose. Such
   information include an individual’s name, position name or title,
   business telephone number, business address, business electronic mail
   address or business fax number and any other similar information
   about the individual.

Limitation of Applicability

The following persons are not subject to compliance with the PDPA, and
will instead continue to be governed by existing common law -

1. Individuals acting in a domestic or personal capacity, by using
   personal data for purposes to do with personal, family or household
   affairs;

2. Public agency, or an entity acting on behalf of a public agency.

Data intermediaries are subject only to safeguarding and retention
provisions of the PDPA. Data intermediaries are defined as organisations
that processes personal data on behalf of another organisation but does
not include an employee of that other organisation.

"Processing" includes the following activities with respect to personal
data -

• recording

• holding

• organisation

• adaptation or alteration

• retrieval

• combination

• transmission

• erasure

• destruction

Obligations under the Law
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PDPA recognises both (i) the right of the individual to protect
their personal data and (ii) the right of organizations to collect, use
or disclose personal data.

The latter right however, is qualified to the extent that the personal
data must be used for purposes deemed appropriate by a reasonable
person.

The following obligations are imposed on organizations which fall within
the ambit of the PDPA –

1. **Consent Obligation**

An individual must give consent for personal data to be collected, used
or disclosed. An individual must be allowed to withdraw consent, with
reasonable notice, and should be informed of the likely consequences of
such withdrawal.

Upon withdrawal of consent by the individual, their personal data can no
longer be collected, used or disclosed.

However, an individual can be *deemed* to provide his/her consent where
–

-  He voluntarily provided such personal data, and it is reasonable for
   him to do so;

-  He consents to the disclosure of his data from one company to another
   – he is deemed to have consented to the collection of his personal
   data by the second company.

The PDPA also provides for exceptions to receiving consent from the
individual, which include –

-  Where necessary to respond to an emergency threatening the life,
   health or safety of an individual;

-  To recover, or to pay a debt owed;

-  To manage or terminate an employment relationship;

-  Necessary in the national interest;

-  If inconsistent with other written laws, e.g. under the Banking Act
   banks do not need to obtain the consent of an individual prior to
   disclosing customer information for the purpose of an application for
   a grant of probate.

1. **Purpose Limitation Obligation**

The organization can only collect use or disclose personal data for the
purpose that the individual has given consent for.

The organisation cannot, as a condition of providing a service, require
the individual to give consent for use beyond what is reasonably needed
for providing such service.

1. **Notification Obligation**

Individuals must be notified of the purpose for which the organisation
is collecting using or disclosing their personal data, before the
organization proceeds to collect, use or disclose the individual’s
personal data.

1. **Access and Correction Obligation**

If so requested, an organisation must provide to an individual, his/her
personal data and the ways in which it has been used or disclosed in the
past year. The organization can levy a reasonable charge for an access
request.

Furthermore, an organisation should correct any errors or omission in
personal data upon the individual’s request. The organization cannot
charge the individual for a correction request.

However, organisations are prevented from providing access if the
provision of the data may:

-  Cause immediate or grave harm to the safety or physical or mental
   health of the individual;

-  Threaten the safety or physical or mental health of another
   individual;

-  Reveal personal data about another individual

-  Reveal the identity of the person who has provided the personal data
   about the individual , and the person has not consented to the
   disclosure of his or her identity;

-  Is contrary to national interest.

1. **Accuracy Obligation**

Personal data collected by the organisation must be reasonably accurate
and complete.

1. **Protection Obligation**

The organisation must implement security measures to protect, and
control or prevent unauthorised use of personal data.

1. **Retention Limitation Obligation**

Personal data and the means by which it can be associated with the
individual, should no longer be retained if it is no longer necessary
for any business or legal purposes.

There is no specific retention period, but an individual can tell an
organisation to stop collecting, using or disclosing their personal data
at any time. However, the organisation is not required to delete or
destroy personal data and may retain it for as long as there are
business or legal needs. 

1. **Transfer Limitation Obligation**

An organisation must ensure that personal data is protected by measures
comparable to those provided under the PDPA when transferring personal
data outside of Singapore.

1. **Openness Obligation**

The organization must, upon request, make available information about
data protection policies, practices and complaints process.

A data protection officer must be designated to implement personal data
protection policies within the organisation. The business contact
information of the data protection officer should be made available to
the public; however the responsibility of complying with the PDPA
remains the organisation’s responsibility.

Penalties
~~~~~~~~~

If found to be in non-compliance, organizations may face financial
penalties of up to S$1 million and additional liabilities in terms of
private rights of action against organisations in breach.

Do-Not-Call Registry (DNC Registry)
-----------------------------------

Organizations are required to check whether a Singapore telephone number is
registered with the DNC Registry prior to sending telemarketing messages, calls, or faxes.

Marketing messages are those which, among others –

-  Offer, advertise or promote goods or services, or the supplier of
   such goods or services;

-  Offer, advertise or promote land or an interest in land, or the
   supplier of such land or an interest in land;

-  Offer, advertise or promote a business or investment opportunity, or
   the supplier of such business or investment opportunity.

Types of messages which are excluded from provisions under the PDPA
relating to the DNC Registry include –

-  Non-commercial nature, such as service calls or reminders;

-  Market survey or research calls;

-  Promotion of charitable or religious purpose;

-  Business-to-business telemarketing calls.

There are 3 DNC Registers –

1. No Voice Call Register

2. No Text Message Register

3. No Fax Message Register

Results from the DNC Registry are valid only for 30 days, after which
the organisation must re-apply to check if a telephone number is
registered.

It must be noted that an organisation can continue sending marketing
messages to an individual where there is an "ongoing relationship". An
ongoing relationship is the conduct of a business or activity
(commercial or otherwise) by the organization for the individual, such
as a subscription, membership, account or loan . A series of one-off
transactions or a past relationship is not sufficient to constitute an
ongoing relationship. However, the organisation must allow the
individual to opt out of receiving marketing messages, if he/she so
wishes.

Limitations of the DNC Registry
-------------------------------

Only Singapore telephone numbers can be registered with the DNC
Registry. An organization cannot therefore contact the individual using
smartphone applications which use telephone numbers as an identifier,
such as Whatsapp.

However, smartphone applications which use an identifier other than a
telephone number, are not covered by the PDPA e.g. iMessage uses an
email address as an identifier, hence marketing messages can be sent by
iMessage, as the email address cannot be registered with the DNC
Registry.

Similarly, email is not included within the scope of the DNC Registry.
However, individuals can use email filters to manage their junk or spam
email.

Breach of the PDPA
------------------

A complaint can be lodged with the PDPC for investigations by providing
the following information:

1. Your particulars (name, NRIC, contact number, etc)

2. The date and approximate time of the call/text/fax you received

3. The Singapore telephone number on which you received the
   call/text/fax

4. If available, the name and telephone number of the person that made
   or sent the call/text/fax

5. If available, the name of the organisation on whose behalf the
   call/text/fax was made or sent (for example, the caller/sender may be
   employed by one company but made the call/text/fax on behalf of
   another company)

6. If available, the contact details (such as a website or telephone or
   fax number) of the organisation involved

7. Contents of the call/text/fax (where applicable, to attach a copy of
   the message received)

8. Whether you have any ongoing relationship (e.g. membership,
   subscription) with the organisation

9. Whether you recall having withdrawn consent from that organisation to
   contact you

The above information should be sent to the PDPC through any of the
following channels:

1. Email: info@pdpc.gov.sg, with the subject title as [Enforcement]

2. Telephone: `6377 3131 <tel:63773131>`__

   | 460 Alexandra Road 
   | #10-02 PSA Building

   |

1. Fax: 6274 7370

Supporting information such as the below should be provided when making
the complaint -

1. Screenshots of the message (including the message date and time of
   the message)

2. Call logs of the telephone number that made the telemarketing call

3. The original fax message received

4. Documents showing that you have withdrawn consent from receiving
   telemarketing messages/calls from the organisation concerned

available provided there is sufficient evidence for the PDPC to
investigate further.

The individual may be expected to make a police statement and/or attend
Court, if necessary.

*Offer of Moneylending Services*

Under the Moneylenders Act, licensed moneylenders are not allowed to
advertise their moneylending services via SMS or voice calls. Therefore,
